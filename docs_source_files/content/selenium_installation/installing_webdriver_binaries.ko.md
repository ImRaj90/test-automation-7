To execute your project and control the browser you need to have
browser-specific WebDriver binaries installed.

Download the [WebDriver binary]({{< ref "/webdriver/driver_requirements.ko.md#quick-reference" >}})
supported by your browser and place it in the 
[System PATH]({{< ref "/webdriver/driver_requirements.ko.md#adding-executables-to-your-path" >}}).
