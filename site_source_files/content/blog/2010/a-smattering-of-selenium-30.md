<p>I&#8217;ve missed a couple weeks due to travel and a complete system lock which meant I lost all the links I had open but not saved. So these are the ones I have recovered.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have written a series of posts on how to do parallel execution of tests in JUnit 4 up on the Sauce Labs blog. <a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/10/parallel-junit-4-and-selenium-part-one-parameters/">Part One</a>, <a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/10/parallel-junit-4-and-selenium-part-two-external-properties/">Part 2</a> and <a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/10/parallel-junit-4-and-selenium-part-three-parallelism-and-ondemand/">Part Three</a></li>

<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=10000">Commit 10000</a> for the Se project. That&#8217;s a non-small number</li>
<li>If you are using Maven 3, you can now use the <a href="http://olamy.blogspot.com/2010/10/maven-selenium-plugin-11-maven-3.html">Selenium Plugin</a> with it now.</li>
<li><a href="http://testobsessed.com/2010/10/20/testers-code/">Do Testers Have to Write Code?</a> applies to Se as well.</li>

<li><a href="http://a-sisyphean-task.blogspot.com/2010/09/set-of-principles-for-automated-testing.html">A Set of Principles for Automated Testing</a> is not a bad list. I completely disagree with the second one, and the last one is blatant employer promotion (but is contextually correct).</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.carbonfive.com/2010/10/testing/rspec-best-practices">RSpec best practices</a> is a similar list which I have less complaint about. The third point is likely the most important one.</li>

<li>Dale Emery has released <a href="http://github.com/dhemery/runtime-suite">Runtime Suite</a> which is super handy for creating test suites at runtime with JUnit 4. It doesn&#8217;t (yet) work with parameterized classes, but is still pretty cool</li>
<li><a href="http://databene.org/feed4junit.html">Feed4JUnit</a> seems to have don&#8217;t some of the legwork for people to do parameterized JUnit scripts. (Yes, I&#8217;ve been stuck in Java-land for the last while; why do you ask?)</li>

Oh, and both 2.0a6 and 2.0a7 have been released. We&#8217;re getting closer to the &#8216;API freeze&#8217; which will mark the end of &#8216;alpha&#8217; and the start of bug fixing (beta) for the final release.</p>
