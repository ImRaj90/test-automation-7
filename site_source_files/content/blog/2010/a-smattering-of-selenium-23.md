<p>I was at Agile 2010 in Orlando last week so missed doing the Smattering, so here is two weeks worth of links.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is crazy amounts of power hiding in that there JUnit 4 library &#8211; such as @Rule. One usage of them is <a href="http://blog.schauderhaft.de/2009/10/04/junit-rules/">described here</a>. A useful pattern indeed when doing something like BDD or ATDD</li>
<li>The next <a href="http://www.meetup.com/seleniumsanfrancisco/calendar/14320878/">SFSE has been announced</a>; August 24 at LinkedIn. Se creator Jason Huggins will be fielding questions in a <i>Q&amp;A session on steroids</i>.</li>
<li>While on topic of meetups, <a href="http://passionatetester.com">Dawn</a> will be presenting about Selenesse at <a href="http://agilecarolinasaugust2010.eventbrite.com/">Agile Carolinas</a> also on the 24th</li>
<li>iCheckWebsite is an accessibility monitoring site which is a niche that I haven&#8217;t seen exploited yet. What is interesting is <a href="http://www.icheckwebsite.com/feature">their checklist of what they check for</a>. Looks like a great start for a suite of Se tests.</li>
<li>Se plays a large part in Continuous Deployment setups, but what I am really interested in is Continuous Delivery. Jez (who literally wrote the book on it) explains <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/2010/08/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment/">the difference between the two</a>.</li>
<li>One of the better sessions I went to at Agile last week was <a href="http://tourdedave.com/i-came-i-saw-i-spoke-at-agile-2010/">Mountains to Molehills: A Story of QA</a> that featured some Se content so gets included here.</li>
<li><a href="http://mariangemarcano.blogspot.com/2010/08/setting-up-flex-testing-with-selenium.html">Setting up flex testing with selenium</a> &#8211; with Selenium Flex API and FlashSelenium</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wakaleo.com/blog/279-selenium-2web-driver-the-land-where-page-objects-are-king">Selenium 2/Web Driver &#8211; the land where Page Objects are king!</a> is the winner of the &#8216;most twitter love for the last two weeks&#8217; award.</li>
<li>Samit continues to churn out plugins for Se-IDE, this time with the <a href="http://reallysimplethings.wordpress.com/2010/08/02/log-search-bar-plugin-for-selenium-ide/">Log Search Bar Plugin</a></li>
<li>The Bromine kids have released a bit of a case study on the Roskilde Festival and CI in <a href="http://blog.brominefoundation.org/2010/07/continuous-integration-of-the-orange-feeling/">Continuous integration of the orange feeling</a></li>
<li>Ooo! <a href="http://www.automatedtestinginstitute.com/home/index.php?option=com_jforms&amp;view=form&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=183">A completely useless tool competition!</a> &#8211; Vote Selenium!</li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/webauthfw/">Web Automation Framework</a> claims to integrate Selenium, TestNG, ReportNG, SimpleXML, Java, Sikuli, Flash-selenium &#8212; which is an interesting fruit salad as it lists apples, oranges, bananas and pears when comparing things.</li>
<li>I hate to pimp my own stuff, but <a href="http://softwaretestpro.com/Item/4859/Six-Shocking-Automation-Truths/Automation-Best-Practices-Software-Test-Professionals-Conference">Six Shocking Automation Truths</a> did fairly well from page view perspective. It even spawned a well thought out <a href="http://discoveredtester.blogspot.com/2010/08/my-take-on-adam-gouchers-six-shocking.html">response/reaction.</a></li>
<li>Again, sorry to have my stuff in here, but if you are wondering what Page Objects are (and how to implement them in Python) then my article <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/magazines/2010-08/page-objects-in-python">Page Objects in Python</a> from the August issue of PragPub is what you need.</li>
<li>Managing Se-Grid machines is a pain (which is why you have companies like Sauce Labs coming into the fray. Another option is to use Copper from GridCentric to have <a href="http://blog.gridcentriclabs.com/2010/07/elastic-build-systems.html">Elastic Build Systems</a></li>
<li>One of the Se 2a6 new features was the Web Timings API which David experiments with in <a href="http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2010/selenium-webtimings-api.html">Automating the Capture of Web Timings with Selenium 2</a></li>
<li>Parallelism is kinda (but not really) solved by Se-Grid, but when you start specing out machines, do you need more <a href="http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/large-business/thread-cores-which-you-need.aspx?dgc=SM&amp;cid=57468&amp;lid=1479422">threads or cores &#8211; and do you know the difference?</a></li>
<li>Robot Framework is growing Flash/Flex support; the status of which can be see in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/flex-pilot/msg/ef60fcadab56fc8e?pli=1">this email from the flex-pilot mailing list</a></li>
