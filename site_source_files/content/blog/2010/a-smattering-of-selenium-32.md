<p>For those people paying attention to the goings-on in the Selenium world, yes, I am skipping something major until some of the details are worked out and announced. Until then, here are the links I accrued over the week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Selenium uses Bamboo for its CI infrastructure. This week saw an upgrade to the latest version so if you want bleeding-edge code, <a href="http://xserve.openqa.org:8085">get it here</a></li>
<li>The only browser Se has no real traction on right now is the BlackBerry one. But if someone wanted to tackle it, here is a post from Atomic Object on <a href="http://spin.atomicobject.com/2010/11/04/our-blackberry-development-environment">their BlackBerry development environment</a> that would help kickstart things maybe.</li>
<li>Under the category of &#8216;let the language deal with things&#8217; is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5lib/">html5lib for python and php</a> which will parse html. Sometimes it is far faster to dump your attribute checks etc. to a native parser than let Se do it.</li>
<li>Scott Sims has released <a href="http://scottcsims.com/wordpress/?p=251">Selenium Fury</a> upon the Ruby world. Think of it as a Page Factory implementation for Ruby.</li>
<li>Using Se-IDE and Easyb? Here is a thread on how to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/easyb-users/browse_thread/thread/0079b48526514a72/3a12e1d253d4b512?show_docid=3a12e1d253d4b512">use the generated code without modification</a></li>
<li>JRuby is one of the better languages to use to write Se scripts in, and here are <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/videos/JRubyConf%202010">videos from JRubyConf 2010</a></li>
<li>Cheezy is writing a series on UI tests. So far there is <a href="http://www.cheezyworld.com/2010/11/09/ui-tests-not-brittle/">How do we keep them from being brittle?</a> and <a href="http://www.cheezyworld.com/2010/11/13/ui-tests-part-two/">Part Two</a></li>
<li>Se2 for JS? Sure, why not. <a href="https://github.com/dmachi/webdriver-js">webdriver-js</a></li>
<li>Jari release the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver">selenium-webdriver 0.1.0</a> gem this week. Why the big jump from 0.0.29 to 0.1.0? We&#8217;ve merged in the selenium-client gem into the main selenium codebase and now there is a single gem if you want to do 1.x or 2.x scripting.</li>
<li><a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/10/google-refine/">Google Refine</a> is just darn cool. I&#8217;m not really sure how it plays into automation, but I get the sneaky suspicion it could. Somehow.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/11/09/introducing-the-new-yui-test/">YUI Test</a> has Se built right in.</li>
</ul>
