<p>Today we&#8217;re happy to announce that Selenium Remote Control 1.0.2 has been released. While most of our efforts are on Selenium 2.0, we understand that there are millions of Selenium users that still need the 1.x line supported. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve said from the start that our goal is make 2.x 100% backwards compatible with 1.x. And that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re releasing a new version of Selenium RC today.</p>
