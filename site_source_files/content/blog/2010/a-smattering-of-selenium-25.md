<p>A day late, but that sort of thing happens when you have family.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>I keep telling myself I will document how to incorporate Se launching and result recording in QC, but never seem to find the excuse. Looks like Aaron found the excuse: <a href="http://fijiaaron.wordpress.com/2010/08/28/finding-the-api-for-a-dll/">Finding the API for a DLL</a>, <a href="http://fijiaaron.wordpress.com/2010/08/28/connecting-to-hpmercury-quality-center-from-a-client-side-script/">Connecting to HP/Mercury Quality Center from a client side script</a></li>
<li>Also from Aaron is a cool <a href="http://one-shore.com/aaron/gencc/">Credit Card Generator</a> which has nice id tags which makes for easy Se parsing. Though I would argue that rather than open a new browser for this you send a URL get or similar, but this works as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://scannell.com">David</a> continues to post about his employer&#8217;s &#8216;Elastic Build System&#8217; in the context of Se-Grid in <a href="http://blog.gridcentriclabs.com/2010/08/nimble-test-clusters.html">Nimble Test Clusters</a></li>
<li>Having had, and then mutually cancelling a book deal on Se, its a delight to see <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/selenium-1-0-testing-tools-beginners-guide/book">Overview of Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools: Beginner’s Guide</a> now available in &#8216;beta&#8217;. Guess you need to finish it now, eh David?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aentos.com/blog/easy-setup-your-cucumber-scenarios-using-headless-gem-run-selenium-your-ci-server">easy setup for your cucumber scenarios using headless gem run selenium your ci server</a> is in the context of cucumber, but could be easily ported to other things I suspect.</li>
<li>Another I-switch-to-Se2-and-liked-it post, this time from Ben at <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/community/blogs/benadderson/archive/2010/08/26/94208.aspx">Switching from Selenium 1.x to WebDriver/Selenium 2 and HtmlUnit</a></li>
<li><a href="http://howfuckedismydatabase.com/">howfuckedismydatabase</a> is just plain funny. And who of us hasn&#8217;t asked that very question &#8211; usually at some less than optimal time</li>
<li>The September gathering of Chicago ALT.NET is on September 8 and is going to be on <a href="http://chicagoalt.net/event/September2010Meeting-Selenium-101-3-Practical-Functional-Testing-Techniques">Selenium 101.3: Practical Functional Testing Techniques</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vrajasankar.blogspot.com/2010/08/testing-flash-with-selenium.html">Testing Flash With Selenium</a> talks about the standard ExternalInterface stuff, but most important is the last sentence: <i>So, if your app has less functions that needs to tested, you can use this approach, if not, testing manually will be the better option.</i>. Just because you can, doesn&#8217;t mean you should (more insight into the life of Selenium consultant&#8230;)</li>
<li>Another framework! This time it is <a href="http://wiki.github.com/meza/Selena/">Selena</a>.</li>
<li>An over-the-should problem-solution post on getting started with Se &#8211; <a href="http://fmk.incipiatturba.net/2010/08/28/fmk-vs-selenium/">FMK vs Selenium</a>. Worth also checking out the &#8216;Modeling Portfolio&#8217; for the, erm, interesting hairstyles he has tried on himself</li>
<li>Seems like <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yeti/">Yeti</a> and Se should work well together, though I can&#8217;t quite figure out why/how. And for those with small kids, the <a href="http://youtu.be/8jPlzKNA0ZU">Yeti Stomp</a> might also be familiar.</li>
