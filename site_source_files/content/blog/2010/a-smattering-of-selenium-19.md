<p>I&#8217;ve got a full day of driving ahead of me to go to a client so this is the early-morning (for me) edition of the Smattering post. That of course means there will be an absolute link explosion in about 20 minutes.<br />

<li><a href="http://seleniumexamples.com">Dave</a> talks about some of the stuff he is doing with Se-IDE in the post <a href="http://seleniumexamples.com/blog/improvements/improving-selenium-ide/">Improving Selenium IDE</a></li>
<li>Another post on how to deal with <a href="http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2010/07/file-downloads-with-selenium-mission-impossible/">file downloads in Se</a>. Mission Impossible no more</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/hue/">Hue Doj</a> got some tweet love as another possible locator strategy for Se. So who wants to write the integration?</li>
<li>I&#8217;m really starting to enjoy JUnit 4. <a href="http://www.testjutsu.com">Ben</a> has been learning about it too and shares <a href="http://www.testjutsu.com/data-driven-selenium-in-junit-via-parameters">Data driven Selenium in JUnit via @Parameters</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fakeapp.com/">Fake.app</a> also got some twitter love. It looks nice, but drag-and-drop script creation and Mac only will ultimately limit its growth capability</li>
<li>There was a contest around the test management system, TestRail. What is cool though is the <a href="http://code.gurock.com/p/testrail-miniapi/">API</a> that they have for it that allows external script engines report into it. It&#8217;s all about the integrations&#8230;</li>
<li>The Bromine project has released <a href="http://brominefoundation.org/cast/Bromine.html">new screencast</a> which showcases Sauce OnDemand and Hudson integration. And it is a really slick integration at that.</li>
<li><a href="http://passionatetester.com">Dawn</a> is <a href="http://java.dzone.com/videos/video-agile-testing-and">interviewed on DZone</a> about Agile testing and SeleNesse (the Se / Fitnesse bridge)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.franciscosouza.net/2010/07/high-level-acceptance-testing-in-your.html?spref=tw">High level acceptance testing in your PHP applications using Python, Lettuce and Selenium</a> is a mini tutorial on umm, well, High level acceptance testing in your PHP applications using Python, Lettuce and Selenium</li>
<li><a href="http://markgandolfo.com/2010/07/01/hudson-ci-server-running-cucumber-in-headless-mode-xvfb">Hudson Ci Server Running Selenium/Webdriver Cucumber In Headless Mode Xvfb</a> is another well named post</li>
<li>If you are using FarCry, <a href="http://farcry.posterous.com/testmxunit-farcry-testing-framework-supports">testMXUnit</a> will take a Selenese script and convert it to a format it needs</li>
<li><a href="http://www.javauc.com/java/2625">Programmatic testing with Selenium and TestNG</a> is a nice post that discusses TestNG, DbUnit, and Cargo</li>
<li>Se-IDE Plugin: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/189780/">Stored Variables Viewer</a> &#8211; <i>This plugin allows you to view these variables when the test is running.</i></li>
<li>Another post from Markus GÃ¤rtner on a European Weekend Testing session on automation with RobotFramework; this time titled <a href="http://blog.shino.de/2010/07/05/parkcalc-automation-a-short-reflection/">ParkCalc automation â€“ A short reflection</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/pinhook/funcunit/tree/master/synthetic">Syn JS</a> claims to provide proper click events for Se 1.x scripts. It was only <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/javascriptmvc/browse_thread/thread/ccd73cf4bcd65c5">soft launched</a> but expect more from these folks in the near future</li>
</ul>

And lastly, BrowserMob, which was started by Se Core member Patrick Lightbody announced that <a href="http://blog.browsermob.com/2010/07/browsermob-joins-neustar-webmetrics-family-of-services/">it has been acquired by Neustar Webmetrics</a>. Congrats! Now stop drinking the champagne and get back to work! ðŸ™‚</p>
