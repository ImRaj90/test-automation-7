<p>A fair number of links this week. The vast majority of which were buried in annoying airport internet advertising frames&#8230;<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>This looks like it is Spanish which would normally mean it doesn&#8217;t get included but it <a href="http://sembugs.blogspot.com/2010/10/integracao-selenium-e-testlink.html">Integração Selenium e Testlink</a> explains how to integrate Se with TestLink. We, as a community, need to document this sort of thing more.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mkyong.com/unittest/junit-4-vs-testng-comparison/">JUnit 4 Vs TestNG</a> is a somewhat biased comparison between JUnit 4 and TestNG; but useful none the less.</li>
<li>Hot on the heels of last week&#8217;s SFSE is the announcment of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/seleniumsanfrancisco/calendar/14966653/">Learn to Test Your SproutCore Apps with Lebowski Framework</a> for the month of October.</li>
<li><a href="http://siark.wordpress.com/2010/10/01/behaviour-driven-development-with-jbehave-web-3-selenium-and-maven-2-on-os-x-snow-leopard">Behaviour Driven Development With JBehave Web 3, Selenium and Maven 2 on OS X Snow Leopard</a> is, aside from very buzzword compliant, the first thing I&#8217;ve seen using Se and JBehave.</li>
<li><a href="http://marlenacompton.com/?p=1877">Bi-Testual: Coming out of the Software Closet</a> is something a lot of people in automation grapple with. Am I a tester who programs? A programmer who tests? Something entirely new?</li>
<li>Using Selenese and want to use Sauce OnDemand? <a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/09/absolute-beginners-guide-to-running-sauce-rc-with-html-scripts/">Absolute Beginners Guide to Running Sauce RC with HTML Scripts</a> is for you.</li>
<li>While combing the Sauce Labs blog, I noticed my <a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/09/how-to-minimize-the-pain-of-locator-breakage/">How To Minimize The Pain Of Locator Breakage</a> has been published.</li>
<li>Page Objects are &#8216;in&#8217; to say the least these days. <a href="http://fijiaaron.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/writing-page-based-tests-with-selenium-in-ruby/">Writing page based tests with selenium in ruby</a> is just enough to get you down the path of page objects in ruby.</li>
<li>And because we can&#8217;t have only one post on Page Objects, <a href="http://luizfar.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/page-objects/">Step-by-step selenium tests with page objects, dsl and fun!</a> is in Groovy</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oliverklee.de/temp/mocking-cheatsheet.pdf">Cheatsheet: Creating mocks in PHPUnit</a> could be useful for those who write Se scripts in PHP</li>
<li>The talks for GTAC 2010 <a href="http://www.gtac.biz/selected-talks">have been announced</a>. I don&#8217;t know what the pool of talks they pulled from was like, but I&#8217;m underwhelmed</li>
<li>I have no idea where <a href="http://www.seleniumwiki.com/">SeleniumWiki</a> came from, but there is a fair bit of content there. Not sure how much is original and how much is lifted from other places on the internets &#8212; the spidey sense tingles when the title says &#8216;VB Code&#8217; which seems to imply it is an SEO hunting site.</li>
<li>Martin Fowler&#8217;s DSL book is out Real Soon Now and the <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/printerfriendly.aspx?p=1592379">first chapter is available online</a>. Most people have been saying &#8216;build a DSL for your scripts&#8217; for awhile &#8212; now we&#8217;ll see just how off all our definitions of that were.</li>
<li>getXpathCount is one of the more powerful commands in Se, but the bulk of people use it &#8216;wrong&#8217;. <a href="http://blog.browsermob.com/2010/09/effectively-using-seleniums-getxpathcount-function/">Effectively using Selenium’s getXpathCount function</a> starts to address that problem.</li>
