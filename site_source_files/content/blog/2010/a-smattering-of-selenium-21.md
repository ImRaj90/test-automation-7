<p>I thought it had been a slow week &#8212; until I looked at how many browser windows I had open. I wonder if that was why things were feeling a bit sluggish&#8230;<br />

<li>Some bits of history from Simon Stewart
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.io.com/~wazmo/blog/archives/2004_10.html#000224">First announcement of Selenium</a> (outside of Thoughtworks)</li>
<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/webdriver/browse_thread/thread/f2f44ac9ccb42e66">First announcement of WebDriver</a> (again, outside of Thoughtworks)</li>
<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/webdriver/browse_thread/thread/b089f9a193e4eec9">The &#8216;merger&#8217; announcement</a> (aka Selenium 2)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More history lessons on <a href="http://cloudcomputingshow.blogspot.com/2010/07/cloud-computing-show-35.html">Cloud Computing Show #35</a> where Jason recounts the origin of Se (and other stuff)</li>
<li>I still maintain that Continuous Deployment <i>to production</i> is near unethical, but a lot of the tricks that companies are using to support it are pretty cool. <a href="http://about.digg.com/blog/continuous-deployment-code-review-and-pre-tested-commits-digg4">Continuous Deployment, Code Review and Pre-Tested Commits on Digg4</a> details some that Digg uses. Only cursory mention of Se, but once you have Se running inside a CI server of some sort, these thoughts become interesting-er.</li>
<li><a href="http://a-sisyphean-task.blogspot.com/2010/05/kitchen-sink-why-not-all-tests-need.html">The Kitchen Sink &#8211; why not all tests need automating</a> has things like <i>Just because we can automate a test doesn&#8217;t mean that we always should</i>. As a consultant, I need to get this point across to clients all the time. Every. Single. Day.</li>
<li>At the risk of being too meta, there is now <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selendion/">Selendion</a> which looks like it drives Concordian with Se</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.thepete.net/2010/07/frank-automated-acceptance-tests-for.html">Frank</a> is billing itself as &#8216;Selenium for iOS&#8217;. Except that I believe Se2 already has support for that.</li>
<li><a href="http://mountaintroll.blogspot.com/2010/07/moving-on-to-second-example.html">Moving on to the second example</a> is part of a series of posts about exploration of Se2 using Ruby. This particular post is the ruby-fication of the second example of the WebDriver tutorial.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2010/07/debugging-xpath-and-css-locators-with-selenium-ide/">Debugging XPath and CSS locators with Selenium IDE</a> originated with a question on the RobotFramework-Users mailing list and ended up being a screencast. We should do more of those.</li>
<li><a href="http://yahoo.github.com/boomerang/doc/">Boomerang</a> seems like a project that someone should write a tutorial on integrating with Se</li>
<li><a href="http://odoe.net/blog/?p=87">Review: TDD Screencasts</a> is a review of Kent Beck&#8217;s new TDD Screencast series (I really should buy this). While yes, we typically don&#8217;t do TDD using Se for speed reasons, this paragraph resonated and since I do the list, I&#8217;m including it.<br />
<br />
<i>A great message I got from the screencasts is that your tests should tell a story. You compose that narrative in steps, so as to not trip yourself up. Many times you are probably required to develop against a backend service or directly with a database. So that’s how the story starts. Hello Mr. Database, are you there? May I put something in you?</i></li>

<li><a href="http://www.rapaul.com/2010/07/18/avoiding-brittle-element-selection-with-selenium2/">Avoiding Brittle Element Selection with Selenium2</a> tackles a constant topic using Se2 &#8212; but it can be applied to Se1 as well</li>
