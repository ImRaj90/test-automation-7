<p>The Selenium project does not have an &#8216;official&#8217; presence here at <a href="http://agile2010.agilealliance.org">Agile</a> as it is seen as a &#8216;test after&#8217; tool rather than &#8216;test first&#8217; &#8212; even though it provides the magic of the &#8216;test first&#8217; frameworks&#8230; But there is a small, unofficial contingent of recognizable faces around that can help people out and some sessions on it.<br />
<br />
<b>Sessions</b><br />
<i>Why your selenium tests are so dang brittle, and what to do about it</i> &#8211; Wednesday, August 11 &#8211; 3:30 &#8211; 5:00<br />
<br />
If you are writing automated through-the-GUI tests for a web application, you are in danger of creating tests that are more expensive to maintain than they are worth. With well-factored Selenium RC tests running in Junit or TestNG, you can keep your abstraction layers or &#8220;Lingos&#8221; &#8212; small bounded bits of slang for discrete parts of the object model &#8212; separate, thereby reducing the maintenance costs of your tests, and improving your sanity. Prerequisites include experience with Java or C#, and ideally some *basic* OOD familiarity (inheritance, composition, encapsulation, polymorphism).<br />
<br />
