<p>The big news for last week was that I released Se-IDE 1.0.8 to very little fanfare. 1.0.9 should be a week or two and much more important a release.<br />

<li><a href="http://seleniumexamples.com/blog/examples/cheesecake/">Cheesecake!</a> is isn&#8217;t nearly as impractical as Pacman, but still adds to the Se2 example bucket.</li>
<li>The London Se Meetup stuff from last week are starting to appear&#8230;

<li><a href="http://www.dafydd.net/archive/2010/continuous-deployment/">Some notes from CITCON</a> last week as well. Seems like London was the place to be.</li>
<li>When designing automation frameworks (internal or external), the list of ways to <a href="http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/index.cgi/tech/2008-03-30.html">make it hard to misuse</a> should be kept in the back of your mind.</li>
<li>Of course your automation is under version control, right? RIGHT?!? <a href="http://whatthecommit.com/">What the Commit</a> is rather amusing, if not a scathing satire. (hint: hit refresh)</li>
<li>Sauce Labs announced the availability of <a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/11/doing-continuous-integration-testing-check-out-our-ci-api/">a CI API</a>. But there is nothing to say that you couldn&#8217;t integrate their <a href="http://saucelabs.com/products/docs/sauce-ondemand#alternative-annotation-methods">alternative annotation methods</a> outside of CI too.</li>
<li>Harry Robinson did a session at CAST 2010 on &#8216;Exploratory Test Automation&#8217; (which I missed; no, not bitter at all..) and I <a href="http://869789182725854870-a-harryrobinson-net-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/harryrobinson.net/www/ExploratoryTestAutomation-CAST.pdf">found his slides</a></li>
<li>If you are using the hosted Bamboo solution and most of your Se tests need windows, then here are instructions <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Creating+a+Custom+Elastic+Image">on how to create your own custom elastic agent image</a></li>
<li>Here is something fun, do you <a href="http://amplicate.com/hate/selenium">Hate</a> or <a href="http://amplicate.com/love/selenium">Love</a> Se?</li>
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/slate">Slate</a> seems like an interesting module for Python folks since it can parse and extract information from PDFs which is often a black hole in automation.</li>
<li>I continue to maintain that automation is programming (much to the annoyance of the classical black-box tester who is starting out with it) and that perhaps the easiest language to start learning is Python. <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/home">Learn Python The Hard Way</a> is a new book which looks like an ideal way to learn the language. I haven&#8217;t really gone through it to see which parts are more (or less) relevant to automation, but&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://elabs.se/blog/15-you-re-cuking-it-wrong">You&#8217;re cuking it wrong</a> has lots of tips on how to write Cucumber scripts well.</li>
