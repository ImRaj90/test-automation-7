<p>Happy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graves_Simcoe">Simcoe Day</a>.  Only a handful of links this week to mention.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Kevin relaunched <a href="http://mogotest.com">Mogotest</a> &#8211; <i>see your website the way your users do.</i></li>
<li>In a much earlier Smattering I think I linked to an announcement about a Se talk at Boston.rb. Well, <a href="http://blog.darnowsky.com/2010/07/27/slides-from-selenium-presentation-at-bostonrb.html">here are the slides</a></li>
<li>While not directly related to Se, the W3C has released their Unified Validator called, wait for it, <a href="http://validator.w3.org/unicorn/">Unicorn</a>. So who is going to create the integration that magically sends pages to be validated there?</li>
<li>&#8216;Ad Hoc Workflows&#8217; appears to be a plugin for Confluence, and is a user of Se. They released a video last week of their <a href="http://www.adhocworkflows.com/display/WWW/2010/07/23/How+we+use+Selenium+to+test+Ad+hoc+Workflows">tests in action</a>. (Make sure to have you volume up for the great soundtrack)</li>
<li>The exploration of Se 2 and Ruby gets even deeper with <a href="http://mountaintroll.blogspot.com/2010/07/adding-automation-to-your-selenium-20.html">Adding automation to your Selenium 2.0 tests (Ruby)</a> &#8211; oh, and RSpec and Rake.</li>
<li>Michael guest posted on this blog on <a href="http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/07/30/how-to-use-selenium-2-with-maven/">How to use Selenium 2 with Maven</a> which was a bit of a mystery as we internally changed how thing work around Maven but forgot to really communicate that.</li>
<li>Sauce Labs is having a webinar this Thursday on <a href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/244624344">Cloud-Based Web Application Testing for Adobe Flex and Flash</a>. Register now, etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://kristjansson.us/?p=947">Selenium browser UnitTesting from TeamCity</a> is full of XML and C# that I&#8217;m sure would make sense to people familiar to TeamCity</li>
</ul>
