<p>We&#8217;ll start this week with the <a href="http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2010/selenium-book-published.htm">official announcement of &#8216;Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools: Beginner’s Guide&#8217; being available</a>. Congrats David! (Still waiting for my copy&#8230;)<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is now a <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-selenium-20?utm_source=feedburner">DZone &#8216;refcard&#8217; for Selenium 2</a>. Of course, the reason Se2 is alpha is the API isn&#8217;t done with at least one major addition still left so it will be out of date in a month, but still&#8230;</li>
<li>Here is <a href="http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc/projects/socorro_qa/">another example of how to do Page Objects in Python</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2010/client-side-profiling-with-selenium-2.html">Client-Side Profiling with Selenium 2</a> is David&#8217;s post about his recent London Selenium User Group talk</a>
<li>Someone took the time to make a <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/selenium-web-testing">Selenium lens</a> on Squidoo; which is going to get kinda circular once this post shows up on it.</li>
<li><a href="http://opineandwhine.blogspot.com/2008/12/why-automated-testing-is-broken.html">Why Automated Testing is Broken</a>. Not much of a commentary here other than A-freaking-men. Ok, that was commentary.</li>
<li><a href="http://seleniumtoolkit.codeplex.com/">Selenium Toolkit for .NET</a> got a version bump for the first time in a year.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.blackpepper.co.uk/driving-a-flex-application-via-selenium-2-webdriver/">Driving a Flex Application via Selenium 2 WebDriver</a> shows how to use FlexSelenium and Web Driver together</li>
<li>RVM is one of the &#8216;cool kid&#8217; tricks and <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/integration/hudson/">Continuous Integration with Hudson</a> is one of those things you need to know how to do if you are using it.</li>
<li><a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> appears to take RVM one (or more) steps further</li>
<li>I keep thinking someone needs to create a Selenium koans site. Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans">javascript koans</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mrdavidlaing/javascript-koans">ruby koans</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.launchlist.net/">Launchlist</a> appeals to me somehow. Throw in an API for launching scripts and you have a nice TCM system</li>
<li>I spent some time figuring out how to integrate Robot Framework with Sauce Labs OnDemand and then <a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/11/integrating-robot-framework-with-sauce-ondemand/">wrote about it</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/webdriver-blackberry/wiki/WebDriverOverview">Web Driver for the BlackBerry</a> &#8211; did not know that even existed.</li>
<li><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gocept.selenium/0.3">gocept.selenium</a> is another Zope 2/Plone/ZTK integration</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wakaleo.com/resources/presentations/306-bdd-atdd-and-page-objects">BDD, ATDD and Page Objects</a> was a talk done at SkillsMatter which was recorded</li>
</ul>
<p>
Oh. and I just noticed that this is the Selenium-iversay edition of these things.</p>
