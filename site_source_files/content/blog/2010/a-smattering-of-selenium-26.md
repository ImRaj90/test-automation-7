<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium-java-evidence/">selenium-java-evidence</a> appears to be another logging framework, this time with an emphasis on auditability. Personally, the reports from a CI server should be all that are required, but to each their own&#8230;</li>

<li><a href="http://github.com/jsa/blogy/blob/master/gae-saucelabs.md">Self-testing AppEngine apps with Saucelabs</a> seems like a cool little (if very low level) trick to using Se inside AppEngine</li>
<li>Sauce Labs released their <a href="http://saucelabs.com/docs/quickstart">Getting Started With Selenium</a> guide and is looking for feedback on it</li>
