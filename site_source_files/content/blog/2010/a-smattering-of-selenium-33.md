<p>&#8230;and here&#8217;s the links!<br />

<li>Henrik Skupin was one of the speakers at the London Selenium Meetup and has <a href="http://www.hskupin.info/2010/11/19/mozmill-crowd-talk-at-selenium-meetup-3-in-london/">written about the night and his talk</a></li>
<li>Speaking of which, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/londonselenium/">videos of the talks are now up</a></li>
<li>Part of good automation is knowing how to code. So here are some sites that crossed my path this week for that
<ul>

<li><a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/">Dive into HTML 5</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/">HTML5 Rocks</a></li>
</ul>

<li>Cheezy continues his UI series which takes a detour over to WATIR land, but things are transferable. <a href="http://www.cheezyworld.com/2010/11/19/ui-tests-introducing-a-simple-dsl/">Introducing a Simple DSL</a> and <a href="http://www.cheezyworld.com/2010/11/21/ui-tests-default-dat/">Default Data</a></li>
<li>Functional Automation is an important part of Continuous Delivery. Here is Jez talking about <a href="http://carlfk.blip.tv/file/4397842">Continuous Delivery</a> &#8212; beer in hand. (which to me is the most important concept of the year)</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/ATDDWithRobotFrameworkArticle">Acceptance Test-Driven Development with Robot Framework</a> is an excerpt from Practices for Scaling Lean &amp; Agile Development.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/bidichecker/">BidiChecker</a> is a tool for checking bidirectional (BiDi) text. So who is going to integrate this into Se?</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.browsermob.com/2010/11/interaction-with-flash-using-flashselenium-and-javascript-part-1/">Interaction with Flash using FlashSelenium and Javascript – Part 1</a> starts to show how to use FlashSelenium to interact with Flash-y things.</li>
<li>Looking for a Selenium job? Have a look at <a href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2010/11/how-to-get-a-rails-job/">How to get a Rails job</a>. When I have hired, or help people hire, this is very true.</li>
<li>And finally the whole should-testers-need-to-know-how-to-code conflict bubbled up again somewhat last week. Since this is my list of links: if you are automating, yes; if you are not, then no (but it can&#8217;t hurt).
