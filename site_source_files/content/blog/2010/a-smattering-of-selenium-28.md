<p>So we go from not-enough-stuff-to-do-one to wow-this-will-take-awhile. And we&#8217;re off..<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tellurium is one of the many frameworks that absorb Se and has an article on InfoQ called <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/tellurium_intro">Introducing the Tellurium Automated Testing Framework</a> which, well, introduces the framework.</li>
<li>In the first of many Cucumber related posts this week is Sean Grove&#8217;s <a href="http://github.com/sgrove/cucumber_sauce">Cucumber Sauce</a> for doing parallel Cucumber runs on the Sauce infrastructure. Might be general enough to use outside of it as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cuke4ninja.com/">Cuke4Ninja: The Secret Ninja Cucumber Scrolls</a>, aside from outstanding ninja cucumber images, has a dead-tree book&#8217;s work of getting starting with Cucumber information.</li>
<li>I updated the list of plugins for Se-IDE (that I know of) on the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">Se-HQ download page</a></li>
<li><i><a href="http://jboss.org/arquillian">Arquillian</a> is testing framework, developed at JBoss.org, that empowers developers to write integration tests for business objects that are executed inside of an embedded or remote container&#8211;options include a servlet container, a Java EE application server or a Java SE CDI environment.</i> Oh, and it has a <a href="http://github.com/arquillian/arquillian/blob/next/extensions/selenium/src/test/java/org/jboss/arquillian/selenium/example">Selenium (1.x RC and 2.x Se WebDriver) extensions</a></li>
<li>The Fall 2010 issue of <a href="http://www.methodsandtools.com/mt/download.php?fall10">Methods &amp; Tools</a> has an article on Bromine</li>
<li>Another piece of Cucumber news is a Skills Matter video of Gojko Adzic and David de Florinier (see Cuke4Ninja able) talking about <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/cucumber-for-web-applications/zx-486">Cucumber &amp; Selenium 2.0</a>
<li>If you are doing automation, the right place to be running it is <i>not</i> the IDE but a CI server. Well, perhaps in addition to the IDE&#8230; Anyways, here is a post on <a href="http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/2009/11/04/setting-up-a-python-ci-server-with-hudson/">Setting up a python CI server with Hudson</a>. Now there is no excuse Python kids&#8230;</li>
<li>Parallel Testing should be this year&#8217;s automation theme. Here is how to do it <a href="http://developer.fellowshipone.com/index.php/blog/running_tests_in_parallel_with_selenium/">in C#</a>.</li>
<li>&#8230;and in <a href="http://atank.interlogy.com/blog/2010/09/parallel-automated-browser-testing-with-selenium-and-sauce-ondemand/">PHP</a> (this one, again with a bent to Sauce OnDemand, but&#8230;)</li>
<li>And yet another <a href="http://github.com/dotsunited/phpunit-selenium-sauceondemand">PHP Sauce</a> integration.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenate/">Selenate</a> is a JS 1.6 runner for Se</li>
<li><A href="http://blog.circlecube.com/2008/02/tutorial/actionscript-javascript-communication/">Actionscript Javascript Communication</a> actually shows how the whole ExternalInterface stuff works when talking into Flash/Flex from within Se. I could have used this a year ago&#8230;</li>
<li>Aside from parallel stuff, I think the Decorators and their kin are nice additions to the automation toolkit. Here is one <a href="http://blog.projectdirigible.com/?p=482">for taking screenshots on test failure in Python</a></li>
<li>London is having another <a href="http://www.meetup.com/seleniumlondon/calendar/14712022/">meetup on November 3</a></li>
<li>The fall 2010 issue of <a href="http://www.automatedtestinginstitute.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1276&amp;Itemid=122">Automated Software Testing Magazine</a> is out. I think its kinda sad that articles on dynamic data generation still need to be written, but the &#8216;Testing With Reflection&#8217; article seems to be not bad in that the message is &#8216;automate to learn, not to test&#8217;</li>
