<p>Not too much this week with various holidays around the world, but still managed to dig some things up.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sauce Labs has started <a href="http://saucelabs.com./about/webinars">a webinar series</a> and recently had one on <a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/06/live-video-demo-using-cucumber-to-test-apps-in-the-cloud/">using Cucumber and OnDemand</a>. Cucumber and Robot Framework like tools are the coming wave of testing tools.</li>
<li>Another bit of Sauce-ish news is the folks at Rally put up <a href="http://www.rallydev.com/engblog/2010/06/29/sauce-ondemand-with-selenium-2-0-and-webdriver/">a post on how to get Se 2 scripts in their OnDemand cloud</a></li>
<li>If writing Se scripts is &#8216;programming&#8217;, then writing the controlling frameworks is <i>real</i> programming. That means that proper development practices should be followed; such as TDD. If you are new to TDD, then The Prags have <a href="http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kbtdd/test-driven-development">released a screencast series by Kent Beck</a> would be helpful. I&#8217;ll be getting this one as soon as my to-watch backlog gets under control.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.ernster.co.uk/?p=15">Re-usable Selenium Testing with GWT</a> has lots of tricks to dealing with GWT widgets &#8212; something which comes up a lot on the Se-Users mailing list</li>
</ul>
<p>
And lastly, the <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/4693">Selenium Stack Exchange proposal</a> has progressed to the next level which is getting people to commit to using it. The number of commits is a convoluted formula, but every one counts. If you think the Se-Users mailing list is too crazy, this format might be better for you.</p>
