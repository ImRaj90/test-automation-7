<p>A bit late, but I&#8217;m in California for a Selenium Developers Meetup and my body doesn&#8217;t quite know where it is temporally.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t forget that tomorrow is the next meeting of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/seleniumsanfrancisco/calendar/14320878/">San Francisco Selenium</a> folks which seems to be running a crowd sourced &#8220;Let&#8217;s stump Jason with our problems&#8221; session. Most of the &#8216;main&#8217; Se folk will be there.</li>
<li>Test design theory is something that I have yet to really see covered much, so here are three articles on the similar idea of what to test and what to skip.

<li><a href="http://motivatedautomator.blogspot.com/2010/08/another-simple-build-radiator.html">Another simple build radiator</a> is just a darn cool re-skinning of Hudson which, while not as fun, is super useful in communicating build status</li>
<li>Simon started to explain some of the work going on in the guts of Selenium WebDriver in <a href="http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/going-atomic-why/">Going Atomic: Why?</a></li>
<li>For those people who loiter in the #selenium irc channel, you have likely seen &#8216;selbot&#8217; in action. If you wondered where it came from you can read the details from Sauce Labs in <a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/08/introducing-selbot/">Introducing selbot</a></li>
<li>Atlassian is a pretty big user of Se and has a post called <a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/developer/2010/08/selenium_push_my_buttons.html">push my buttons</a> which explains the myriad of ways you can send a key in Se 1.x. Which IIRC is one of the major improvements that Se 2 provides.</li>
<li>The march of Flex Pilot continues and so the blog posts from users are starting to appear including <a href="http://mariangemarcano.blogspot.com/2010/08/selenium-testing-with-flex-pilot.html">Selenium Testing with Flex Pilot</a></li>
<li>I was pleading for help on twitter last week and this <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seuenium.com.br%2F2010%2F01%2F04%2Fcapturando-a-tela-com-o-selenium-e-junit%2F">cool use of the JUnit 4 @Rule annotation to get screenshots on test failures</a> was provided</li>
