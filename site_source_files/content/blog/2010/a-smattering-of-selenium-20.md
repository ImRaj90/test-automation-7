<p>12 hours late, but I was driving draft horses all day so that&#8217;s my excuse and I&#8217;m sticking with it. Enjoy. I&#8217;m going for a nap.<br />

<ul>
<li>The big news this week was the <a href="http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/selenium-2-0a5-released/">next alpha of Se 2 came out</a>. Time to update those automation machines.</li>
<li>Like TestNG&#8217;s @BeforeClass and @AfterClass but using JUnit4? <a href="http://www.eviltester.com/index.php/2010/07/17/using-junit-nested-suites-with-selenium-rc-to-simulate-testng-suite-and-grouping-annotations/">Using JUnit Nested Suites with Selenium RC to simulate TestNG suite and grouping annotations</a> is a long titled post, but describes how to fake one out to act like the other.</li>
<li>Also on the topic of TestNG is the announcement of <a href="http://www.nabeelalimemon.com/blog/2010/07/selenium-on-testng/">Selenium on TestNG</a></li>
<li>The folks at ActiveState did a survey in their community about tooling and <a href="http://www.activestate.com/blog/2010/07/survey-says-selenium-nose-most-popular-test-framework">Selenium won</a></li>
<li>I had to hack DNS a bit for a client&#8217;s Se setup to work the other week, but that seems pretty kludgey compared to <a href="http://twasink.net/blog/2010/07/selenium-trick-using-a-different-dns/">Selenium Trick: Using a different DNS</a></li>
<li>Using ExtJS? According to <a href="http://www.jslog.com/testing-extjs-with-selenium-automating-ui-tests">Testing ExtJS with Selenium Automating UI Tests</a> the trick is to use CSS as your location strategy</li>
<li>Jason Huggins was interviewed by Matt Heusser in <a href="http://www.softwaretestpro.com:80/Item/4832">Episode 3 of TWiST</a></li>
<li>If you are doing Se, then you are doing code. If you are converting &#8216;classic&#8217; manual testers to do automation you need to start thinking about <a href="http://deancornish.blogspot.com/2010/07/training-testers-in-how-to-code.html">Training Testers in how to code&#8230;</a></li>
<li>While not directly related to Se, <a href="http://blog.nobien.net/2010/07/19/practicing-continuous-integration-on-flash-projects-using-hudson/">Practicing Continuous Integration on Flash Projects: Using Hudson</a> is the wrapup post in a series on doing what it says. If you are doing CI, and of course <i>everyone</i> is, then it needs to be for all parts of your system</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.shino.de/2010/07/18/parkcalc-automation-–-keyword-driven-tests-in-fitnesse/">ParkCalc automation – Keyword-driven tests in FitNesse</a> wraps up the series by Markus Gärtner that has been mentioned the last two weeks as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.buberel.org/2010/07/howto-test-jquery-ajax-autocomplete-menus-with-selenium.html">HOWTO: Test JQuery AJAX autocomplete menus with Selenium</a> details something that is fairly common I think.</li>
