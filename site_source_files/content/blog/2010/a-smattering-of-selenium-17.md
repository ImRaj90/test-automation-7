<p>Here are the posts dealing with Se, and/or automation in general that caught my eye and interest.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codekoala.com/blog/2010/selenium-unit-test-reuse/">Selenium Unit Test Reuse</a> illustrates one way of iterating through environments and browsers in a script without using Se-Grid. I&#8217;ve done similar tricks to this to some success &#8212; the problem is usually reporting though, but you are all clever folks so I&#8217;m sure you could add it in.</li>
<li>Adding a custom header is sometimes required when writing a script, but its not really that documented so Kevin wrote <a href="http://mogotest.com/blog/2010/06/23/how-to-perform-basic-auth-in-selenium">How to Perform Basic Authentication in Selenium</a> which combines how to do basic auth <i>and</i> header injection.</li>
<li>Not running your scripts inside CI yet? Shame on you! Hudson creator Kohsuke Kawaguchi <a href="http://about.digg.com/blog/digg-technical-talks-kohsuke-kawaguchi">gave a talk at Digg</a> which they recorded. I haven&#8217;t watched it yet, but Se gets a mention according to the notes at the bottom.</li>
<li>Haven&#8217;t heard of the HAR (HTTP ARchive) format? Don&#8217;t worry, I hadn&#8217;t either until <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-developers/browse_thread/thread/aafbe61c46ffa0df">a bit of a discussion about the captureNetworkTraffic</a> was had and its future in Se</li>
<li>The Faker/Sham combination is established in the Ruby (and Perl) world as the way to generate random data of a prescribed format. Anthony has release a similar module for Python with some pythonic twists called <a href="http://github.com/antlong/Picka">Picka</a> (as in &#8216;Pick a card, any card&#8217; erm, well, name or address actually)</li>
<li>Looking for an example of Page Objects in C#? I was last week and Dave convienently enough posted a <a href="http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/tutorials/selenium/page-object-pattern.htm">page object pattern tutorial</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.testjutsu.com/adieu-to-qtp-now-for-a-closer-look-at-selenium">Adieu to QTP. Now for a closer look at Selenium</a> makes the list just because it uses &#8216;QTP&#8217; and &#8216;Chinese bile farm&#8217; in the same sentence.</li>
<li>Browsermob opensourced <a href="http://github.com/lightbody/browsermob-sep4j">sep4j</a> (which I think stands for &#8216;Se Parallel for Java&#8217;) which is a <i>Collection of utilities for Java-based projects to enable Selenium test parallelization using Selenium Grid or Sauce<br />
Labs.</i></li>
<li>Richard presented at the LJC Unconference on &#8216;Agile Acceptance Testing with Cucumber, Cuke4Duke, Groovy &amp; Selenium&#8217; and has <a href="http://www.rapaul.com/2010/06/26/agile-acceptance-testing-slides/">posted his slides</a></li>
<li>Speaking of acceptance tests, Gojko has a post on the <a href="http://gojko.net/2010/06/16/anatomy-of-a-good-acceptance-test/">Anatomy of a good acceptance test</a></li>
<li>Last thing on acceptance tests for this week is actually multiple things. Markus recently did a Weekend Testers event using RobotFramework and ParkCalc and has started a series of posts about it: <a href="http://blog.shino.de/2010/06/20/parkcalc-automation-getting-started/">Getting Started</a>, <a href="http://blog.shino.de/2010/06/24/parkcalc-automation-refactoring-a-data-driven-test/">ParkCalc automation – Refactoring a data-driven test</a> and <a href="http://blog.shino.de/2010/06/26/parkcalc-automation-refactoring-a-keyword-driven-test/">ParkCalc automation – Refactoring a keyword-driven test</a> are the first three posts in it. Hopefully there will be more too.</li>
<li>And I&#8217;ll finish with one of my posts from this week which was on how to <a href="http://element34.ca/blog/dealing-with-file-downloads-with-selenium">deal with pesky file downloads in Se</a>. (hint: don&#8217;t use Se for downloading files)</li>
</ul>
