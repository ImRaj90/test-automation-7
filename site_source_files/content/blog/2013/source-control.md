<p>This short technical note is to announce that the Selenium project is now using <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/checkout">git on Google Code</a> in place of subversion.</p>
<p>The move has been a long time in the making, and it&#8217;s largely thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://twitter.com/krosenvold">Kristian Rosenvold</a> that we&#8217;ve been able to do the migration and retain the project history. The project owes him a huge thank you! We&#8217;re in the process of migrating the last bits and pieces (none of which are user facing), so there may be some last minute turbulence as we settle everything down.</p>
<p>Although the canonical source will be on <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/">Google Code</a>, we&#8217;re working on setting up a github mirror. We&#8217;ll announce the location of that once it&#8217;s set up.</p>
