<p>Hrm. Office is closed until Monday, but everyone is in. Very confusing&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>One reason I have heard people say they don&#8217;t use cloud instances is they are afraid they will just sit around idle when not needed. <a href="http://atlee.ca/blog/2012/12/14/behind-the-clouds/">Behind the clouds: how RelEng do Firefox builds on AWS</a> has some useful scripts to find and teardown machines.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters">Page Weight Matters</a> is a fun little insight into how/why YouTube shed some of its heft. And a reminder that what we need is more stuff coming out of bandwidth starved regions since we have forgotten how to program efficiently in North America / Europe.</li>
<li><a href="http://usetrace.com">Usetrace</a> looks like the newest player in the Selenium-in-the-cloud space. Seems to use the Python bindings as the scripting language and host the scripts too.</li>
<li>Did you know that you can modify the Se Server&#8217;s Grid functionality with plugins? Neither did I &#8212; or at least I don&#8217;t think I did&#8230; Here is a <a href="https://github.com/freynaud/grid-plugin-tutorial">tutorial</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AutomatedTester/speedy-gonzales-proxy">another example</a>.</li>
<li>The interesting part of <a href="http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/whose-bug-is-this-anyway">Whose bug is this anyway?!?</a> is &#8216;Your computer is broken&#8217; bit. Oh, and make sure that build machine is updated to what your developers are running&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://synesthesiam.com/?p=218">Modeling How Programmers Read Code</a> is just cool.</li>
<li>Speaking of reading code; <a href="http://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/12/23/code-reading">Code Reading</a>. I wonder if you gave this to a novice programmer if they would approach the above link differently.</li>
<li><a href="http://ariya.ofilabs.com/2012/12/phantomjs-1-8-blue-winter-rose.html">PhantomJS 1.8 “Blue Winter Rose”</a> got lots of twitter love. As it should have.</li>
<li><a href="http://nikic.github.com/2012/12/22/Cooperative-multitasking-using-coroutines-in-PHP.html">Cooperative multitasking using coroutines (in PHP!)</a> is, I think, pretty awesome just by the my inability to fully grok what is going on. I also have no idea how to use this for automation purposes, but it seems like there should be some usage for it somewhere&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.littlehart.net/atthekeyboard/2012/12/17/so-you-want-to-write-tests">So You Want to Write Tests</a> is more mindset than code &#8230; but code has always been the easy part anyways.</li>
