<ul>
<li>So I was trying to find <a href="http://requests.ryanmccue.info/">Requests for PHP</a> whilst talking to <a href="http://grumpy-phpunit.com/">the grumpy programmer</a> and he pointed me out to <a href="http://guzzlephp.org/index.html">Guzzle</a> which looks equally cool</li>

And illustrates why you should learn your tools &#8212; if they didn&#8217;t know about custom annotations and their runners in JUnit they would have missed this.</li>
<li>Yet another JS testing framework has grown a webdriver tentacle &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-webdriver-launcher">karma-webdriver-launcher</a></li>
<li>I barely understand a word of <a href="https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2012/08/method-decorators-and-combinators-in-coffeescript.md#method-combinators-in-coffeescript">Method Combinators in CoffeeScript</a> which is often a sign I should include something</li>
