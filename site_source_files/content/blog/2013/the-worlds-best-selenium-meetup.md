<p>Note from Adam: This is a guest post from <a href="http://twitter.com/tourdedave">Dave Haeffner</a> who, along with <a href="http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/">David Burns</a> hatched this idea at SeConf2013.</p>
<p><strong>Selenium Meetups are great, but&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to attend a Selenium Meetup but there&#8217;s not one near you? Or maybe there is but something&#8217;s come up and you can&#8217;t make it out that night? Or maybe the meetup near you struggles to get good speakers and have a consistent schedule? [Note from Adam; like, say, the Toronto one&#8230;]</p>
<p><strong>We can do better</strong></p>
<p>Well, what if there were a way to attend a meetup regardless of location?</p>
<p>And what if each meetup you attended was lined with core maintainers of the Selenium project?</p>
<p>And if you missed it, what if the whole thing was recorded and available for you to review at your leisure?</p>
<p>Well, now you can.</p>
<p><strong>The World&#8217;s Best Selenium Meetup</strong></p>
<p>Introducing Selenium Hangout &#8212; the world&#8217;s best and most accessible Selenium meetup. An entirely online meetup that leverages Google Hangouts and live streaming to YouTube. All meetups will be recorded and posted online afterwards.</p>
<p>Each meetup will contain a small panel of people from the Selenium Community (e.g. core committers, automation practitioners, etc.) and they will discuss various topics (TBD).</p>
<p><strong>How to attend</strong></p>
