<p>A hardy welcome back to work to our American friends who spent Thursday being thankful for what they had, then getting into fist fights at stores for things they thought they didn&#8217;t need the next day.</p>
<ul>
<li>You know what would be grand? If various widget makers would provide automation hooks for their stuff so we, as automators, don&#8217;t have to write them ourselves. Like for High Charts (<a href="https://github.com/Ardesco/Powder-Monkey/tree/master/src/main/java/com/lazerycode/selenium/graphs">in Java</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2012/11/19/Why-you-should-never-use-a-boolean-field-use-an.aspx">Why you should never use a boolean field (use an Enum instead)</a> is food for thought when designing your page objects</li>
<li>Do you work for Google? No? They why do you think you need to automate GMail?!!? Not a new rant of course, but <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/imapIO/0.9.5">imapIO</a> looks like it might not suck too too much if you are solving this problem in Python and must get an email out of GMail</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/3361208">windows.h.js</a>. Yes. .js. And no, I have no idea what you would use it for.</li>
<li>Someday I will find the time to learn <a href="http://blog.tddium.com/2012/11/20/profiling-ruby/">Profiling Ruby, or, How I Made Rails Start Up Faster</a> for Python and/or PHP if just so I <i>really</i> understand what goes on under the hood. (And you should too. Understand that is&#8230;)</li>
<li>Two more OTA API examples; <a href="http://fijiaaron.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/creating-a-bug-in-quality-center-using-the-ota-api/">Creating a Bug in Quality Center using the OTA API</a>, <a href="http://fijiaaron.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/executing-tests-in-quality-center-using-the-ota-api/">Executing Tests in Quality Center using the OTA API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://craigkerstiens.com/2012/11/17/how-i-write-sql/">How I Write SQL</a>. Mmmmm pretty. And the killer part is right at the end; <i>While very long, this should ideally be quite legible</i> and legibility trumps length every day.</li>
<li>Before you whinge, understand <i>why</i> something is. Like say, <a href="http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.ca/2012/11/are-you-kidding-me-ie-driver-another.html">Are you kidding me, IE Driver? Another freaking thing to download?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pivotallabs.com/users/patn/blog/articles/717-run-javascript-in-selenium-tests-easily-">Run JavaScript in Selenium tests. Easily</a>. And by Selenium they mean WebDriver and by WebDriver they mean Webrat.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/MobileTestingSummit">Mobile Testing Summit videos are up!</a> for those of us that couldn&#8217;t make it. Or could have made it were it not for speaking commitments bookending it on the other side of the continent.</li>
