<li><a href="https://github.com/github/janky">Janky</a> is GitHub&#8217;s CI server. Seems like this is the current cool route; that is, implementing your own rather than building off of one of the major existing ones. Which I suppose makes sense.</li>

<li>Looks like ShingingPanda is the Python equivalent of CloudBees, and has instructions on how to get Selenium running on it in <a href="http://blog.shiningpanda.com/2011/11/shiningpanda-is-selenium-ready.html">ShiningPanda is Selenium ready!</a></li>
<li>Articles that lead in with <i>Boy.  That was a headache.</i> are usually good ones to link to. <a href="http://shizen008.wordpress.com/2011/12/13/webdriver-webdriver-and-more-web-driver">WebDriver, Webdriver, and more web driver.</a> This one is about the WebDriver iOS driver.</li>
