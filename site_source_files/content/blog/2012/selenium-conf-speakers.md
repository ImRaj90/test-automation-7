<p>I may be biased, but I think <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/">Selenium Conf &#8217;12</a> is going to be great. There are talks aimed at every level of Selenium user. We&#8217;ve got<a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#MD"> experience</a> <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#NS">reports</a>, so you can learn from the trials and tribulations of others. There are talks about using Selenium in unusual ways, such as <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#MK">performance testing</a>, or<a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#AP"> automated security testing</a>, so you can see new ideas and approaches.</p>
<p>There are technical talks, such as the one Jim Evans is giving on lessons learned from <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#JE">developing the IE driver</a>, so you can learn a little bit more about how Selenium works and <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/#LD">Luke Daley&#8217;s talk</a> about <a href="http://www.gebish.org/">Geb</a> is bound to be fun.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/">Selenium IDE</a>, then the <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers">talk on the SauceBuilder</a> will be a &#8220;must see&#8221;. We&#8217;ll also have the current owners of Selenium IDE attending the conference, so you&#8217;ll get a chance to pick their brains on the future of the tool.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re someone who enjoys living in the future, then the mobile focused talks, such as Andreas Tolf Tolfson&#8217;s talking about <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers#ATT">OperaDriver on mobile devices</a>, or Dante Briones talking about <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers#DB">testing mobile apps on iOS</a> will be interesting. And Jason Huggins will be talking about <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers#JH">robots</a>. What&#8217;s not to love?</p>
<p>Better still, we&#8217;ve left space in the schedule in Track B for an unconference. If you put forward a talk this year that wasn&#8217;t accepted, or if you&#8217;ve got something you feel the Selenium community should hear, now&#8217;s your chance! If you&#8217;ve only got a little to say, or just want to make a single point, then you&#8217;re really going to enjoy the lightning talks!</p>
<p>All of this is available for the<a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/tickets/"> cost of the ticket</a>, which you can still buy. Don&#8217;t wait! Come to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23seconf">#SeConf</a>!</p>
