<li><a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/06/building-and-profiling-high-performance.html">Building and profiling high performance systems with Iago</a> is getting a bump by being released at/during Velocity. Not browser based, but what its being used for doesn&#8217;t need browsers.</li>
<li><a href="http://grosser.it/2012/04/19/testing-geolocation-with-capybara-selenium-firefox/">Testing geolocation with capybara + selenium + firefox</a> is an interesting trick to address something I haven&#8217;t thought of needing yet.</li>
<li><a href="http://selenium.polteq.com/en/run-your-selenium-tests-in-the-cloud-with-testingbot/">Run your Selenium tests in the cloud with TestingBot</a> kinda looks like astroturfing but illustrates how to use TestingBot with Java.</li>

<li><a href="http://sqlfiddle.com/">SQL Fiddle</a> has the same root word but is very different. Though I am not really sure how wise it is to let a web app construct your schema. Magic rarely results in days that don&#8217;t end in tears.</li>
