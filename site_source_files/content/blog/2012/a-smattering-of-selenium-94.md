<li>What&#8217;s that? You weren&#8217;t happy with one of the six PHP WebDriver clients that were out there already? Have another one &#8212; <a href="https://github.com/Nearsoft/PHP-SeleniumClient">Nearsoft/PHP-SeleniumClient</a>. It&#8217;d be spooky what would happen if we all got together on this.</li>

<p> is hilarious. Well, from a &#8216;been there, done that, crap I forgot to revert&#8217; perspective.</li>
<li>Yes, packaging is a hard problem. No, I don&#8217;t know how to even begin to solve it. <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2012/6/22/hate-hate-hate-everywhere/">Python Packaging: Hate, hate, hate everywhere</a> is kinda a history lesson on what the current state of the world is in Python.</li>
<li>Oh, and because this is what happens on the internets, there is a bigger discussion of the previous article over on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4147368">Hacker News</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aharin/inproctester">inproctester</a> is a standalone J2EE app server for running HTMLUnit WebDriver scripts</li>
<li>Its a bit amusing [though not to a lot of people] how much love parts of WebDriver get from the world at large and how much hatred other parts get. <a href="http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.ca/2012/06/whats-wrong-with-internet-explorer.html">What&#8217;s Wrong With the Internet Explorer Driver?</a> enumerates some of the causes, why they got that way, and throws down the gauntlet to Microsoft. Who will promptly do, erm, nothing&#8230;</li>
