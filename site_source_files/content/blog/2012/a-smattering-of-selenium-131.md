<p>Not sure how widely broadcast this has been (cus, you know, we&#8217;re good at communicating and stuff), but if you are using 2.26.0 and Firefox 17 you will get a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4814">nasty bug</a>. 2.27.0 is in the works to address this (and a couple other things&#8230;) so if you <i>need</i> FF right now, keep your install at the <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/16.0/">latest 16 release</a>.</p>

Even the poster children for Continuous Deployment actually do Continuous Delivery (humans! shocking!). Oh, and the usual gloss over &#8216;cluster immune system&#8217; which is the only part of this tend that has an elegant solution.<br />
