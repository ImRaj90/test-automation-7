<p>Can&#8217;t get enough Se bloggage? Have a look at <a href="http://itkosmopolit.wordpress.com/2012/11/23/overview-of-selenium-blogs/">Overview of Selenium Blogs</a> &#8212; though I must say there has to be something wrong with the Alexa algorithm if I am that far down the list. And behind both David and Alister. ðŸ™‚</p>
<li><a href="http://durdn.com/blog/2012/11/22/must-have-git-aliases-advanced-examples/">Must Have Git Aliases: Advanced Examples</a> reminds me of someone I used to work with who likely couldn&#8217;t function on a clean unix system, but with all his aliases was mind blowing to watch</li>
<li><a href="http://techblog.safaribooksonline.com/2012/11/23/writing-a-selenium-test-framework-for-a-django-site-part-3/">Writing a Selenium Test Framework for a Django Site (Part 3)</a> has the usual myths and FUD around XPath and embeds locators in the script method but is the first thing I&#8217;ve seen that uses the Color class in Python so I&#8217;ll overlook those things. This time.</li>
<li><a href="https://makandracards.com/makandra/12661-how-to-solve-selenium-focus-issues">How to solve Selenium focus issues</a> introduced me to jQuery&#8217;s :focus pseudoselector</li>
<li>I&#8217;m sure there is something to be learned from <a href="http://evan.tiggerpalace.com/articles/2012/11/21/use-rails-until-it-hurts/">Use Rails until it hurts</a>. Especially from the paragraph above the twitter inclusions</li>
<li><a href="http://watirmelon.com/2012/11/27/checking-an-image-is-actually-visible-using-webdriver/">Checking an image is actually visible using WebDriver</a> is something I plan on stealing.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kirsle.net/blog/kirsle/android-4-0-in-virtualbox">Android 4.0 in VirtualBox</a> seems like a cool way to build out an android build farm</li>
<li><a href="http://phpmaster.com/autoloading-and-the-psr-0-standard/">Autoloading in PHP and the PSR-0 Standard</a> has some Symfony specific bits, but is generally useful</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/danni/2012/11/19/extending-selenium-with-jquery/">Extending Selenium with jQuery</a> is something else I intend to steal</li>
<li>From the same person is <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/danni/2012/11/15/combining-py-test-and-selenium-to-test-webapps/">Combining py.test and Selenium to test webapps</a> which shows off some of what py.test can do with fixtures. Not how I would do it, but cool none the less.</li>
<li>Let me say this again; the officially blessed solution for getting response codes is to route your calls through a proxy (like the BrowserMob Proxy) and then ask it what they were. But if you are bound and determined to craft &#8216;solutions&#8217; that only work in a single browser, or a single language, or require changing your application then <a href="http://www.ninthavenue.com.au/how-to-get-the-http-status-code-in-selenium-webdriver">How To Get The HTTP Status Code In Selenium WebDriver</a> will make good breakfast reading. North American time that is&#8230;</li>
