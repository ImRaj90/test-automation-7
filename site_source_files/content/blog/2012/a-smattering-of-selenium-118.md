<p>&lt;Insert witty/snarky commentary on something here&gt;</p>
<ul>
<li>Apparently the TestWatchman thing I linked to is deprecated now in favour of TestWatcher (shows how much I pay attention to JUnit stuff&#8230;). <a href="http://blog.zvestov.cz/item/98/catid/16">Here is an example of TestWatchers and RuleChains</a>. No, I don&#8217;t know what the blurb at the top says.</li>
<li>Sure, we&#8217;ve all see lorum ipsum text, but do you know what it (ish) says? <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum">now you do</a></li>
<li>From the &#8216;MEASURE ALL THINGS!!!&#8217; category is Mozilla&#8217;s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/BuildFaster">BuildFaster</a>. There was a cool graph of build times I saw somewhere too&#8230;</li>
<li>The kids at Google have released <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/wicked-good-xpath-faster-javascript.html">Wicked Good XPath: a faster JavaScript XPath library</a>. I suspect Se will be growing this appendage fairly soon-ish. And then we get to re-learn all the gotchas of a new library. ðŸ™‚</li>

<li>Dear Google Code team; <a href="https://github.com/blog/1252-how-we-keep-github-fast">How we keep GitHub fast</a>.</li>
<li>There seems to be lots of good stuff on <a href="http://darrellgrainger.blogspot.ca">Darrell Grainger&#8217;s blog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mjp.github.com/2012/08/29/github-python-analysis.html">An Analysis of the Top Python Repositories Hosted on Github</a> is interesting. I have no idea how to apply this to Se, but still&#8230;</li>
