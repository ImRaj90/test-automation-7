<p>Within an hour I had some more things to add to the last Smattering. Oh well, I&#8217;ll just save them up&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://roydekleijn.github.com/har-assert/">Har-assert</a> looks like something useful to include in your project if you are using Java. And the browsermob-proxy (which of course, you all are)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a> seems like something more people should care about.</li>
<li>Right. Here is another cool part of the nebulous, meaningless thing called HTML5. <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/pagevisibility/intro/">Using the PageVisibility API</a>. Anyone want to take bets on how long this gets used for evil rather than awesome?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/KentBeck/junit/blob/master/doc/ReleaseNotes4.11.md">JUnit 4.11</a> is out. The link is to the release notes. The &#8216;test execution order&#8217; stuff seems like bowing to pressure rather than good test design&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.dynatrace.com/2012/11/14/why-averages-suck-and-percentiles-are-great/">Why Averages Suck and Percentiles are Great</a> is your monthly statistics lesson.</li>
<li>Alright, here is the challenge for everyone who wants to get involved in the project but is afraid they cannot code well enough. (If I can code well enough, so can you&#8230;) The docs can always use more people! And then we should get !se to work on via <a href="http://duckduckhack.com">DuckDuckHack</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jarmo/test-page">Test::Page</a> is another helper for making Page Objects in Ruby</li>
<li>The first item in <a href="http://www.jpuopolo.com/2012/09/an-impassioned-plea-to-other-start-up-founders-to-use-automated-tests/">An impassioned plea to other Start-up founders to use automated tests</a> is the only one that really holds any water. The rest, well, is showing the author&#8217;s developer bias I think. (The rest of his blog seems pretty good as well.)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rainbowdriver">RainbowDriver</a> looks interesting. Though after the flurry around the Mobile Test Summit there seems to be no more commits&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/research/2012/11/12/introducing-the-shumway-open-swf-runtime-project/">The Shumway Open SWF Runtime Project</a> Not sure how I feel about Shumway. On one hand, open is better than closed, but from an automation perspective, SWF is a <i>pain</i></li>
