<p>Good news, everybody! <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/">Selenium Conf &#8217;12</a> is getting closer! We recently <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/">selected the speakers</a> for the conference, and it&#8217;s going to be a great mix of talks, spanning the full range of subjects from the very practical to the deeply technical. I&#8217;m promised that there will be robots.</p>
<p>Selenium Conf isn&#8217;t just about the planned talks, it&#8217;s also about the community. On the final day, there will be an unconference, so if there&#8217;s something you feel passionately about and feel the world should know, now&#8217;s your chance. You&#8217;ll not only have a chance to talk to and meet other selenium users, but also many of the core team members.</p>
<p>The conference runs from the 16-18 April in London. <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/tickets/">Tickets are still available</a>! We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing you there.</p>
