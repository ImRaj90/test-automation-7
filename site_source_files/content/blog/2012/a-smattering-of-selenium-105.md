<p>This was supposed to go out Friday, but the flu bug I picked up decided to move the schedule about somewhat.</p>
<ul>
<li>As Se marches towards being a W3C standard, the sort of thing in <a href="http://gist.io/3170829">OAuth and API Providers: Come on guys.</a> scares me more and more.</li>
<li><a href="http://journal.ryanmccue.info/165/why-wp_error-sucks/">Why WP_Error Sucks</a>. Intelligent error handling is hard. Especially when you have a legacy install base to deal with. A nice little rant.</li>
<li>Normally you see lists from people about books individuals want to see written, but Heroku has gone one step further and has released <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/open-topics">Contribute a Dev Center Article</a> of articles they want to see written about how to use their stuff. Brilliant?</li>
<li>Issue 141 is getting some publicity this week featuring prominantly in a talk I&#8217;ve given 3 times in the last two weeks and now Jim answers once and for all the question of <a href="http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.ca/2012/07/webdriver-y-u-no-have-http-status-codes.html">WebDriver: Y U NO HAVE HTTP Status Codes?!</a>. Who am I kidding? There is no way this goes away. <i>USE A PROXY!</i></li>
<li><a href="http://paste.ubuntu.com/1111807/">find a valid and unused port to listen on</a> is a nice little shell script that does exactly what it says. Was posted in the context of finding a port for grid nodes to listen to iirc</li>
<li><a href="http://ardesco.lazerycode.com/index.php/2012/07/how-to-download-files-with-selenium-and-why-you-shouldnt/">How To Download Files With Selenium And Why You Shouldn’t</a> echos a lot of what I say around scripting downloads. Also notice the bit at the end about checking status codes if you have an unnatural phobia of proxies</li>
<li><a href="http://blargon7.com/2012/07/bidpom-drops-support-for-selenium-rc/">BIDPOM drops support for Selenium RC</a> I think is the first project I have seen come out and explicitly drop support for Se-RC. I expect to see more of this over the next year.</li>
<li>I haven&#8217;t gone through it yet, but it looks like I need to pick up some Objective-C skillz soon and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html">About Objective-C</a> looks pretty good from the quick skim I did.</li>
<li>I converted to OSX partly because it was FreeBSD way, way, <i>way</i> under the hood. <a href="http://www.semioticpixels.com/crib-notes/mac-10-7-path-settings-and-environment-variables/">Mac 10.7 $PATH Settings And Environment Variables</a> really shows how divergent things have come. But is something you need to know when building slave machines</li>
<li>Speaking of Mountain Lion, <a href="http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/07/interesting-new-unix-commandsbinaries-in-os-x-mountain-lion/">Interesting new UNIX commands/binaries in OS X Mountain Lion</a>. Something about calling a utility that keeps the machine from going to sleep &#8216;caffeinate&#8217; cracks me up.</li>
