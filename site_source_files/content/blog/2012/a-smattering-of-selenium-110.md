<p>Dear body; what time zone are you in?</p>
<p>Ah well, until that battle resolves itself, here are some links.</p>
<li><a href="http://sauceio.com/index.php/2012/08/firefox-the-clear-winner-for-automated-testing/">Firefox the Clear Winner for Automated Testing</a> has a wonderfully SEO friendly title, but really is just some cool usage graphs for their system. Extrapolate beyond that at your own risk.</li>
<li><a href="http://simplythetest.tumblr.com/post/29058868277/task-automation-ftw">Task Automation FTW!</a> &#8212; make your application installable! I did something like this a decade ago (also using python) but finding something in my own blog seems a harder challenge than it should be.</li>
<li><a href="http://julianhigman.com/blog/2012/08/09/running-saucelabs-selenium-test-suite-locally-with-phpunit">Running SauceLabs Selenium test suite locally with PHPUnit</a> explains how to solve my number one complains for the various BaaS vendor plugins.</li>
<li>And TextMate is <a href="https://github.com/textmate/textmate">now Open Source</a>, ya! Under GPL3. Oh&#8230;</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t know what IFTTT is, or how to see the actual script [without joining], but <a href="http://ifttt.com/recipes/48831">Capture all Smatterings of Selenium entries to Evernote</a> might be of interest to people. If a bit meta to be linking to it.</li>
<li>So Patrick Lightbody isn&#8217;t at Neustar (which bought Browsermob) any more (congrats on the new gig at New Relic btw!) so I was a bit worried about what was going to happen with the BrowserMob Proxy. Seems the GitHub effect has happened once more and there are others also <a href="http://blog.stuartherbert.com/php/2012/08/10/tweaking-browsermob-proxy/">Tweaking BrowserMob-Proxy</a>.</li>
<li>As is the case with similar articles to <a href="http://blog.joocode.com/browsers/12-things-about-the-webkit-inspector-i-didnt-know/">Things I didnâ€™t know about the WebKit inspector</a>, read the comments for more things you likely didn&#8217;t know.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.thepete.net/blog/2012/05/09/javascript-feature-flags/">Feature Flags in JavaScript</a> &#8211; do this!</li>
<li><a href="http://scottcsims.com/wordpress/?p=382">Managing browsers from the command line on OS X</a> is a bit of shell trickery I&#8217;d ashamed to admit I didn&#8217;t know. Well, the <i>open</i> bit at any rate.</li>
<li><a href="http://codeduicodefirst.codeplex.com">Code First API Library, Scaffolding &amp; Guidance for Coded UI Tests</a> seems very WebDriver-esque in how to do things. Go Team! ðŸ˜‰</li>
