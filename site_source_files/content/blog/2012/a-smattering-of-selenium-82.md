<p>Someone explain to me why I&#8217;m in Toronto and not Florida?</p>

<li>I would really like to see less &#8216;howto&#8217; blog posts that repeat the same basic information and more experience reports like <a href="http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/deja-vu-code-culture-and-qa.html">deja vu: code, culture, and QA</a>. Oh, and it serves as a nice reminder that automation is more than just regression; its about producing information that starts conversations</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/mguillem/JSErrorCollector">JSErrorCollector</a> solves for Firefox something I think is missing from Se &#8212; which is the collection of JS error messages from the browser.
