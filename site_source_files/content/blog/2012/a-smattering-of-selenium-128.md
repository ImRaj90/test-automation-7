<p>&#8230;as I avoid writing code that deals with dynamically constructed tables. Without any sort of unique locator. Of course.</p>
<ul>
<li>I would contend that the &#8216;right&#8217; solution to this problem is to use a CI container and have it email you, but if you are using Java and not using CI, then <a href="http://assertselenium.com/2012/11/13/emailable-reports-for-selenium-scripts/">Automatically Email the Reports After Selenium Test Execution</a> could be valuable.</li>
<li>I feel like I have already linked to <a href="http://www.jeromemueller.ch/archives/311/webdriver-staleelementreferenceexception">Webdriver StaleElementReferenceException</a> but the archive search is, erm, not great, so here it is again. Notice the solutions to what are all synchronization problem is <i>not</i> to turn on implicit waits.</li>
<li>A lot of the reason for lighting up a browser is to be able to do input with the app; <a href="http://c2.com/ppr/checks.html">The CHECKS Pattern Language of Information Integrity</a> is useful reading in this regard</li>
<li>While I wait for MS to send me a free Surface to play with (*hint*), <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee804820(v=Surface.10).aspx">Testing Applications by Using the Surface Simulator Automation API</a> seems like they have at least given the problem some thought. Of course, it starts with a hand-holding of how to use an IDE. How very Android of them.</li>

<li>I don&#8217;t the Opera kids get enough credit for what they&#8217;re doing (and did first iirc) &#8211; <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/introducing-mobile-browser-automation/">Introducing mobile browser automation</a></li>
<li>If you brain didn&#8217;t hurt yet, it will now. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6771258/whats-the-difference-if-meta-http-equiv-x-ua-compatible-content-ie-edge">What&#8217;s the difference if &#8220;&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;&quot; exists or not?</a></li>
<li>OAuth2 seems to have died a public flaming death, so some smart folks created <a href="https://github.com/hueniverse/oz">oz</a>. There is some snark I can&#8217;t find about not liking a fork so creating a new one and now you have n+1 problems or something&#8230; <i>All</i> auth system suck BTW.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Julian/Ivoire">Ivoire</a> has some RSpec goodies &#8212; but in Python</li>
<li>What? You&#8217;re not using data-* attributes yet? Shame on you&#8230;
