<p>Hurray for having fillings done on both sides of my face. Don&#8217;t expect me to speak without drolling for rest of the day.</p>
<li>I&#8217;ll admit to not knowing what the difference is/was between FluentWait and WebDriverWait, but <a href="http://seleniumsimplified.com/?p=340">FluentWait with WebElement</a> explains it well. With sample code!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.digbymarksit.com/2012/08/18/phpunit-selenium-php-webdriver-hours-of-entertainment-part-1/">PHPUnit + Selenium + php-webdriver = hours of entertainment (Part 1)</a> shows a nice extension to PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase. Now if only he was using my <a href="https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver">active fork</a> of the php-webdriver bindings rather than the original project Facebook seems to have abandoned.</li>
<li>Speaking of Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-rebuilding-facebook-for-ios/10151036091753920">Under the hood: Rebuilding Facebook for iOS</a> is going to be oft cited in the whole &#8216;html5 or native&#8217; discussions for the next while I think</li>
<li>Santi spoke at the recent San Jose Selenium Meetup; <a href="https://my.adobeconnect.com/p3xgh7qcvdn?launcher=false&amp;fcsContent=true&amp;pbMode=normal">video</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bayh58Xhz8eBjxZvYZoxfvYcWnC9fiAP-h7LklLxGjo/edit?pli=1#slide=id.p">slides</a></li>

<li><a href="http://shauninman.com/tmp/retina/">Automatic Conditional Retina Images</a> seems like something we should know how to check if its being loaded properly or not. Guess I need to go buy an iPad to check this out&#8230;</li>
<li>Puppet Labs updated some of their documentation recently; <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/">Puppet 2.7 Reference Manual</a>, <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/facter/1.6/core_facts.html">Factor 1.6 Core Facts</a></li>
<li>Reddit opensourced <a href="https://github.com/reddit/push">push</a> which is yet another deployment tool. Remember though, you are likely not Reddit.</li>
<li>Hey lookit! The WhiteHouse <a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petition/tree/7.x-1.x/selenium">uses Selenium</a>. Though the scripts are Selenese. And named .php for some unknown reason. Actually, they look a lot like they were created as part of some sort of scaffolding. Anyone?</li>
<li>Not sure what to do with it, but <a href="http://blog.streamingmedia.com/the_business_of_online_vi/2012/08/updated-list-of-vendors-in-the-content-delivery-and-transparent-caching-markets.html">Updated List Of Vendors In The Content Delivery and Transparent Caching Markets</a> looks rather useful. Or not.</li>
