<p>Its the &#8216;all github&#8217; edition today!</p>
<ul>
<li>Dave goes a little strange on us with his <a href="https://github.com/tourdedave/diy_framework">diy_framework</a> as an <i>emoting robot</i>. Here is <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/tourdedave/selenium-basics/2">the deck</a> that went along with it.</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t get enough of the food-based frameworks from the kids at Sauce. If you are using the PHPUnit included WebDriver bindings [and Sauce OnDemand] then <a href="https://github.com/jlipps/sausage">Sausage</a> could be of interest.</li>
<li>Of course, if you are just using PHPUnit, then <a href="https://github.com/jlipps/paraunit">paraunit</a> could of interest. I&#8217;ve written similar before, but this looks cross-platform.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/plone/buster-selenium">buster-selenium</a> is, erm, well, Selenium for buster.js</li>
<li>Why did I only learn about <a href="https://github.com/xdissent/ievms">ievms</a> now? Oh. Well, one of the requirements is patience. That explains it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/videlalvaro/gifsockets">gifsockets</a>; I&#8217;ll wait while you pick up the pieces of your exploded brain</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/3725732">How to capture a FF profile log</a>. Dunno what gets put in it, but tuck this away in your back pocket</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t have a use case for <a href="https://github.com/benoitc/flower">flower</a> but <i>collection of modules to build distributed and reliable concurrent systems in Python</i> seems link-worthy</li>
<li>Again, not sure when you would use it, but <a href="https://github.com/asconix/webdriver-user-agent-randomizer">webdriver-user-agent-randomizer</a> seems darn cool</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t see too many open-source ios apps, so here is <a href="https://github.com/simonmaddox/GoogleTransit-iOS6">GoogleTransit-iOS6</a></li>
</ul>
