<p>Happy day off Canuckistan! I&#8217;ll be in California in two weeks; here is <a href="http://element34.ca/blog/california-tour-summer-2012">my schedule</a> &#8212; come by and chat</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://allianceglobalservices.com/blog/selenium-rc-to-webdriver-migration-â€“-part2">Selenium Rc to Webdriver Migration â€“ Part2</a> is included mainly for the IE bit. Busted SSL certificate? Don&#8217;t work around the problem &#8212; fix it! Can&#8217;t find an element? Synchronize properly &#8212; don&#8217;t just bap it in the face with the magic implicit wait wand&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers?feature=watch">Google I/O 2012 Videos</a> won&#8217;t give you the loot attendees got, just the content.</li>
<li>Does WebDriver support <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/versions/jelly-bean.html">Jelly Bean</a> yet? /me ducks and runs for cover</li>
<li><a href="http://www.crashlytics.com/blog/scaling-continuous-integration-cutting-test-time-by-77/">Scaling Continuous Integration â€“ Cutting Test Time by 77%</a> &#8211; my Spidey sense says that the next wave of tooling is about dynamic script selection, parallelization and general speediness-ing. In this article <i>since thereâ€™s no longer a need to delay arbitrary amounts of time</i> is the killer line.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.jquery.com/2012/06/28/jquery-core-version-1-9-and-beyond/">jQuery Core: Version 1.9 and Beyond</a> seems rather optimistic. WebDriver should be immune [I think] though so if your scripts break, its the app! ðŸ™‚</li>
<li>Myth #2 of <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/chrismdp/p/cucumber-its-about-talking-not-testing">Cucumber: It&#8217;s about Talking not Testing</a> is outstanding. And sadly, nearly ubiquitous</li>
<li><a href="http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2012/02/01/unicode-for-dummies-encoding/">Unicode for dummies â€” Encoding</a> &#8211; be afraid of any article that starts with <i>The basic concepts are simple</i>. Then brace yourself and read it anyways. Unicode is important.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/cloudpowered-continuous-integration-and-deployment-architectures-jinesh-varia">Cloud-powered Continuous Integration and Deployment architectures</a> is very AWS centric (obviously given the author) but still pretty good.</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t get enough of Responsive Design? How about <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-images-how-they-almost-worked-and-what-we-need/">Responsive Images: How they Almost Worked and What We Need</a></li>
<li>This would have been more relevant last week when it was <a href="http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/back-to-the-future-day-hoax-hits-again/272599">Back To The Future day</a>, but <a href="https://github.com/bebanjo/delorean">Delorean</a> lets you muck about with time in your Ruby scripts</a></li>
