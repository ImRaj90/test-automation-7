<p>I should have learned not to boast about getting caught up with links.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://blargon7.com/2012/02/automating-browserid-with-selenium/">Automating BrowserID with Selenium</a> is pretty awesome. (As is BrowserID.) Now if this was only installable via pip or easy_install&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://rubyreloaded.com/trickshots/">Ruby Trick Shots</a> &#8211; heed the disclaimer; <i>not an exercise in Ruby best practices</i></li>
<li><a href="https://devblog.xing.com/qa/keep-it-functional-iphone-test-automation/">Keep It Functional – iPhone Test Automation</a> talks about another automation framework for mobile. At some point Selenium is going to grow Objective-C bindings I fear.</li>
<li>Requests for Python is fantastic. <a href="http://requests.ryanmccue.info/">Requests for PHP</a> looks to be equally so. (I suspect my <a href="http://element34.ca/blog/introducing-phpwebdriver">php webdriver bindings</a> are about to become a much larger fork of the Facebook ones.)</li>
<li><a href="http://test.techwell.com/articles/membersub/test-automation-project">Is Test Automation a “Project”?</a> &#8211; hint: it&#8217;s not.</li>
<li><a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2012/01/sfse-meetup-video-keeping-selenium-tests-100-blue/">Keeping Selenium Tests 100% Blue</a> is a video of January&#8217;s SFSE. And <a href="http://blog.testyredhead.com/2012/01/31/selenium-meetup-west-coast-style.aspx">Selenium Meetup West Coast Style</a> is a rebuttal.</li>
<li><a href="http://4cupsr.us/blog/2012/1/8/seleniums-sweet-spot-preventing-catastrophes.html">Selenium&#8217;s Sweet Spot: Preventing Catastrophes</a> shows that there are still people who do not watch for Black Swans. Automation does not prevent catastrophes. Well, at least ones that you are not looking for already.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.cloudspokes.com/2012/01/automate-salesforce-administrative.html">Automate Salesforce Administrative Tasks with Selenium</a> has the results of the contest they ran.</li>
<li><a href="http://robert.arles.us/node/150">ErrorList object for use in TestNG/Selenium testing</a> is a soft-assert implementation</li>
<li><a href="http://gazit.me/2012/02/01/iterations.html">Iterations</a> has an outstanding time-lapse of how the Pycon US logo was designed. Someone should do this scripting out a website.</li>
</ul>
<p>And my post that I&#8217;m going to link against is a bit of a rant around <a href="http://element34.ca/blog/how-to-choose-selenium-training">how to choose selenium training</a>. Though it has also been pointed out that a lot it applies outside the scope of Selenium as well.</p>
