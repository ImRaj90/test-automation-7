<li>I think I said I wasn&#8217;t going to link to <i>headless gem</i> posts, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve linked to one about Cucumber.  <a href="http://sermoa.wordpress.com/2011/07/02/cucumber-running-headless-selenium-with-jenkins-the-easy-way/">Cucumber running headless Selenium with Jenkins (the easy way)</a>; fixed</li>
<li><a href="http://errorception.com/">Errorception</a>, and things like it, are the next wave of infrastructure to come I think now that things like BrowserMob Proxy are becoming mainstream-ish-er</li>

<li><a href="http://cheggeng.github.com/Bromine/">Bromine</a> has been released. No. Not <i>that</i> bromine that was associated with Selenium for years. This one is an Event.js based project for automation. Innocent naming conflict, indifference &#8212; or SEO land grab? (Just teasing&#8230;)</li>
<li><a href="http://filipin.eu/test-automation-at-homeswap-com/">Test automation at HomeSwap.com</a> is likely watir based, but likely worth a view anyways. (Like how I say that implying like I don&#8217;t have 15 weeks of videos backlogged already&#8230;)</li>
