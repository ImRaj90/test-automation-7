<li>SST (Selenium Simple Test) comes out of Ubuntu and has a quick introductory screencast.<br />

<li><a href="http://www.cloudspokes.com/challenges/1353">Automate Salesforce Config Changes with Selenium</a> is a contest. But only for Java so I have no interest in it. Submissions are due in two days. Could be fun.</li>
<li><a href="http://cssify.appspot.com/">cssify</a> is a great little app for converting xpath to css. Now to see what sorts of devious xpath we can put in and blow Santi&#8217;s mind with bug reports. ðŸ™‚</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/01/continuous-delivery-with-bamboo-stages/">Continuous Delivery with Bamboo Stages</a> &#8211; I normally call these &#8216;chains&#8217; but nicely shows how to chunk the march to production. It also cracks me up that the corporate twitter feed has <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/brittpwalker/status/160520765832314881/photo/1">the upgraded beer cart</a> photo in the sidebar right now.</li>
<li>One talk I skipped at Codemash the other week was on Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/UIAutomationRef/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009771">UI Automation</a> stuff. I suspect this is the low-level implementation of things like native-driver which is valuable to have at ones fingertips.</li>
<li>While not automation related directly, if you are automating Android stuff you should also be looking at the <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/index.html">Android Design</a> site to understand the idioms and such that the platform thinks you should be using</li>
<li><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2742-the-road-to-faster-tests">The road to faster tests</a> is a fantastic write-up of an investigation into why their scripts were so slow. I&#8217;ve been doing this a lot recently. Well, investigating slowness at least.</li>
<li>I actually got the above link from <a href="http://engineering.socialcast.com/2012/01/how-we-reduced-our-test-runtimes/">How We Reduced Our Rails Test Runtimes By 10x</a> which is an even larger investigation write-up.</li>
