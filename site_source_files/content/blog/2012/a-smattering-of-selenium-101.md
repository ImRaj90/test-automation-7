<p>Really? A drought for most of the week and now I&#8217;ve got a queue again in the span of 3 hours?</p>

<li><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/nicola/p/developing-restful-web-apis-with-python-flask-and-mongodb">Developing RESTful Web APIs with Python, Flask and MongoDB</a> is toolchain dependent, but likely enough cross-tool-ism to be worth a quick click through</li>
<li>The cool part of <a href="http://hackers.mylookout.com/2012/07/jasmine-testing-with-saucelabs/">Jasmine Testing With Sauce Labs</a> isn&#8217;t necessarily the Jasmine part, but the Sauce Connect Puppet part. Though Jasmine is high on my cool list.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mobileapptesting.com/google-offers-all-in-one-mobile-app-analytics/2012/07/">Google Offers All-In-One Mobile App Analytics</a>. Woohoo! More things to slow down the mobile experience. And for us to figure out how to block to not get in the way of automation.</li>
<li><a href="http://element34.ca/blog/webdriverwait-and-python">WebDriverWait and Python</a> is mine, but documents part of the driver that doesn&#8217;t have too much coverage right now</li>
<li>I think there is a bit too much generalization with the usage of &#8216;they&#8217; (see &#8216;They think it is more good than harm. They are proud how popular it is.&#8217;) but <a href="http://filipin.eu/dragon-chicken-says-once-upon-a-time-a-knight-that-knew-only-record-playback-came-to-fight-me-it-was-a-lot-of-fun/">Dragon Chicken says: &#8220;Once upon a time a knight that knew only record-playback came to fight me. It was a lot of fun.&#8221;</a> discusses one of the points that keeps the Watir and Se communities at arms-length from each other. Not that they should be&#8230;</li>
<li>UI Testing at Tradeshift is a decent article on how, well, they do UI Testing at Tradeshift. Like most series, the latter ones are the more technical ones but the the first one does provide &#8216;the story so far.&#8217; <a href="http://tradeshift.com/blog/ui-testing-at-tradeshift-pt-1/">part 1</a>, <a href="http://tradeshift.com/blog/ui-testing-at-tradeshift-pt-2/">part 2</a>, <a href="http://tradeshift.com/blog/ui-testing-at-tradeshift-pt-3/">part 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/3086536">Highlights a Selenium Webdriver element</a> is another bit of code I think I&#8217;ll liberate. Well the idea at any rate since I&#8217;m not using his page model.</li>
<li><a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/get-test-infected-with-selenium-2">Get Test-Infected With Selenium</a> is a Python WebDriver tutorial. Not too horrific.</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/3086272">A Python list-like wrapper around WebDriver&#8217;s support.select.Select class</a> is another one of mine and is pretty out there; both in terms of what I was doing, and the level of meta I went to.</li>

And something we&#8217;re all going to have to add to our toolkits.</li>
