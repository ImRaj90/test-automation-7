<p>Right&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Scripting batch 1: waiting for an email</li>
<li>Scripting batch 2: waiting for an email</li>
<li>Scripting batch 3: waiting for an email</li>
<li>Scripting batch 4: waiting for an email</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ll do something else right now&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Alright kids, its not the Olympics, but <a href="http://www.flaminglunchbox.net/curvy">Curvy</a> would be a fun app for someone to automate.</li>
<li>Wow that was fast. <a href="http://vimeo.com/user4280938">Øredev</a> has started to publish the videos from this year&#8217;s conference. Lots of good things in there.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2012/the-right-tool-for-the-job.html">The right tool for the job!</a> is one of my favourite rants. And one that catches people off guard when I mention it &#8212; &#8216;but you are a selenium consultant&#8217;&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://watirmelon.com/2012/10/16/mobile-apps-still-need-automated-tests/">Mobile apps still need automated tests</a>. Yup. Of course, its not like the OS vendors are helping their developers to do this. Actively hindering them is more like it&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/">On Being A Senior Engineer</a>. Somewhere, a newly minted &#8216;Senior QA Developer&#8217; fresh out of school is having a bit of a cry&#8230;</li>
<li>Right. So how would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance">Composition over inheritance</a> affect the Page Object pattern. Or perhaps not affect, but what would that look like?</li>
<li>Hrm. <a href="http://eclim.org">Eclim</a> might be how to make Eclipse not suck.</li>
<li>And while I am taking cheap shots at Eclipse &#8230; <a href="http://www.recursivity.com/blog/2012/10/28/ides-are-a-language-smell/">IDEs Are a Language Smell</a>. Or put another way, Dear Android&#8230;</li>
<li>Someone (or someones) should do a time analysis of writing out scripts something like <a href="http://www.developsense.com/blog/2012/10/where-does-all-that-time-go/">Where Does All That Time Go?</a>. I suspect though that a lot of automation would be cancelled as a result though.</li>
<li><a href="https://wonderproxy.com">WonderProxy</a> seems like it might be a useful tool. Especially if you are doing behaviour based upon where you are. Though wow it is annoying to be somewhere you don&#8217;t speak the language and have your language cookie ignored. *cough* google *cough*</li>
</ul>
