<li><a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1874863">Automated Software Testing: An Example of a Working Solution</a> is an interesting take on designing an automation system for the US DoD.

<li><a href="https://github.com/alp82/abmash">Abmash</a> aims to deal with the element location problem only using the visible cues a user could see. In my experience, this leads to scripts that work fine &#8212; until you need to deal with multiple languages at which point it falls on its face. Hard. But&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://python3porting.com/improving.html">Improving your code with modern idioms</a> is Python focused and is something I need to keep open whenever I write new code&#8230;</li>

<li><a href="http://www.clockwise.ee/gasmask/">Gas Mask</a> seems like it would be pretty cool. There are of course some bugs, and the project seems rather dormant. Oh. And writing Objective C is a pain&#8230; but I really want something like this!</li>
