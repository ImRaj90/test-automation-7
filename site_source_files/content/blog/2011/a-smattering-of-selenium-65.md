<p>Trying something new; queuing up the catch-up post while I have time to catch-up.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve been lead to believe that <a href="http://community.jboss.org/en/arquillian/blog/2011/09/17/functional-testing-with-arquillian">Functional Testing with Arquillian</a> is a Big Deal&amp;tm;. Of course, I just see a lot of Java&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7700929/python-multiprocessing-map-if-one-thread-raises-an-exception-why-arent-other">If one thread raises an exception, why aren&#8217;t other threads&#8217; finally blocks called?</a> is an interesting question with a nice answer. If you start running scripts in parallel, this, and the GIL is something to keep in mind.</li>
<li>My favourite part of posts like <a href="http://blogs.telerik.com/jimholmes/posts/11-10-15/using-test-oracles-to-ensure-your-tests-rsquo-true-validity.aspx">Using Test Oracles to Ensure Your Testsâ€™ True Validity</a> is they always have a &#8216;this is how I learned this the hard way&#8217; story in them.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m getting more and more convinced that the route to WebDriver powah! is through the JavascriptExecutor. As illustrated in <a href="http://paulhammant.com/2011/09/30/setContext-back-for-selenium2/">setContext(..) is back for Selenium2 ðŸ˜›</a></li>
<li>One important trick to maven is knowing how / where to bind server control to. <a href="http://blog.synyx.de/2011/10/testing-webapp-startup-on-jenkins-with-maven-tomcat-and-web-driver/">Testing webapp startup on Jenkins using Maven, Tomcat and Web Driver</a> might be a bit grand a title, and is using HTMLUnit (why?! do your customers use that browser? really?) but illustrates the maven part well.</li>
<li>Since we&#8217;re in the HTML (findin yur bugz) whilst automating anyways, <a href="http://line25.com/articles/youre-doing-it-wrong-common-html-tag-misuse">Youâ€™re Doing it Wrong: Common HTML Tag Misuses</a> is something to keep at the back of your mind.</li>
<li>And since we&#8217;re critiquing the HTML, why not how the database schema is designed and its impacts on API design. <a href="http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2011/09/24/identifiers-are-not-numbers/">Identifiers are not numbers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antecedent/patchwork">Patchwork</a> is a library that lets you monkey patch in PHP. Haven&#8217;t found a need for it yet, but I keep thinking I will.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/making-facebook-self-healing/10150275248698920">Making Facebook Self-Healing</a> is just darn cool. And unfortunately most things in the Immunization/Healing space are highly customized and not really candidates for open sourcing.</li>
