<p>It&#8217;s catch-up time again! Here is the first 10.</p>

<li>Robot Framework&#8217;s <a href="http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary/wiki/ReleaseNotes27">SeleniumLibrary 2.7 has been released</a> primarily to pick up 2.0b3 of the Selenium Server.</li>
<li>There was a series of posts about using Selenium with Drupal recently.

</ul>

<li><a href="http://unmesh.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/using-xpath-axes-for-locating-elements-in-selenium/">Using XPath Axes for locating elements in Selenium</a> discusses some of the more advanced ways of finding elements via XPath</li>
<li>I&#8217;ll follow that up with a link to the <a href="https://github.com/santiycr/cssify">cssify</a> project which will attempt to automatically convert XPath locators to CSS</li>
<li>And since we&#8217;re now onto CSS&#8230; <a href="http://andy.edinborough.org/CSS-Stress-Testing-and-Performance-Profiling">CSS Stress Testing and Performance Profiling</a> discusses the <a href="https://github.com/andyedinborough/stress-css">stress-css</a> bookmarklet. Which you can integrate into your Se scripts using a trick I discuss <a href="http://element34.ca/blog/dom-monster-and-selenium">here</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gregretkowski/vmth/">VMTH (Virtual Machine Test Harness)</a> seems like another thing to put into the automated deployment toolkit</li>
<li><a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2011/04/gtac-2011-cloudy-with-chance-of-tests.html">GTAC 2011</a> has been announced &#8212; seems to be moving away from the hard-core automation geekery that it was when it started.</li>
<li>WatirGrid <a href="http://altentee.com/blogs/2011/watirgrid-1-0-6-released-can-haz-selenium/">can haz Selenium</a> if you want a different model of browser distribution and are using Ruby. Naturally, <a href="http://gridinit.com/public/examples">Gridinit also supports both now</a></li>
