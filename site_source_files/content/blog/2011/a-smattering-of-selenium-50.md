<p>Half a century!</p>
<p>And because I am late doing this, the <a href="http://www.theautomatedtester.co.uk/blog/2011/selenium-test-day-amo-240511.html">Selenium Test Day for Addons.Mozilla.org</a> &#8212; which is <i>today!</i> gets top billing. Its actually going on Right Now. Looking to practice script writing and/or up your profile? This is a great way.</p>
<p>And now for the usual stuff.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://testerthoughts.com/2011/05/17/guest-post-net-headless-browser-options/">.NET Headless browser options</a> looks at various options that might be available to you if you want something like HTMLUnit but for .NET.</li>
<li>CSS vs. XPath is one of the great talking points in the Se community. And until now there hasn&#8217;t been any hard information to support the claims. <a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2011/05/why-css-locators-are-the-way-to-go-vs-xpath/">Why CSS Locators are the way to go vs XPath</a> now solves that problem.</li>

<li><a href="http://mkaz.com/archives/1705/functional-testing-with-selenium-webdriver-and-scala/">Functional Testing with Selenium WebDriver and Scala</a>. Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever actually seen that language before.</li>
<li>Here is a useful StackOverflow question &#8211; <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/211487/how-to-add-a-junit-4-test-that-doesnt-extend-from-testcase-to-a-testsuite">How to add a JUnit 4 test that doesn&#8217;t extend from TestCase to a TestSuite?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.bettersoftwaretesting.com/?attachment_id=24">&#8216;Pushing the boundaries of User Experience Test Automation&#8217; slides</a> from the STEP-AUTO conference. Not that useful without Julian in front of them, but check out slide 17</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/kohsuke/current-state-of-jenkins">Current State of Jenkins</a> deck is interesting, but slide 9 specifically is what the Se community could learn from.</li>
<li>Need to add automation hooks? Have a look at the <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/">data- attributes</a>. Why, oh why don&#8217;t I use these more?</li>
<li>People should write more spelunking post like <a href="http://rubysource.com/spelunking-selenium-in-search-of-sockets/">Spelunking Selenium in Search of Sockets</a></li>
<li>I&#8217;m doing a <a href="http://www.pushtotest.com/adam-goucher">webinar for PushToTest</a> on Thursday. Haven&#8217;t done one of those before&#8230;</li>
<li>A <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/agile-testing/talk-by-dave-farley">Continuous  Delivery video from the London Test Gathering</a> &#8212; I really wish I had time to watch videos these days.</li>
<li>If you are using Python&#8217;s unittest module, then <a href="https://launchpad.net/pyjunitxml">PyJUnitXML</a> is going to help prevent you from re-re-rewriting the &#8216;ant junit xml&#8217; format</li>
<li><a href="http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/">Traits</a> is a bit of a type system for Python. I think.</li>
<li>Not that I use any of these, but <a href="http://alexsotob.blogspot.com/2011/04/are-you-locked-up-in-world-thats-been.html">this seems like a nice tutorial on JBehave, Spring MVC and WebDriver</a></li>
<li>Looking for Snake Oil? I present to you <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/alexknapp/2011/05/18/researcher-develops-automatic-software-testing/">Snake Oil</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/twin/">twin</a> looks rather cool. Now all it needs is the same language support as WebDriver and we might have a tight way to deal with the desktop and browser</li>
<li>So who is going to add a link to <a href="http://twist4all.wordpress.com/2011/05/21/logging-selenium-2-events-in-twist/">Logging Selenium 2 Events in Twist</a> or similar to the Se Documentation?</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/cheezy/page-object">page object gem</a> could help with adoption of this pattern. Or could hopelessly confuse the pattern with the gem&#8217;s implementation of the pattern. Based on past experience, my money is on the latter.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/the-architecture-of-open-source-applications/15819207">The Architecture of Open Source</a> book has been released and includes a chapter on Selenium by Simon Stewart. Buy it from this link, not Amazon &#8212; all royalties are going to Amnesty International and Amazon takes a huge slice</li>
