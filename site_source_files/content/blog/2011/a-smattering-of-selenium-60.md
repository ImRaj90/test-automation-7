<p>This instalment of catch-up week is brought to you by the letters C and I.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/pre-scm-buildstep">pre-scm-buildstep</a> plugin for jenkins adds a useful step into the job workflow.</li>
<li>Understanding your tools is important. Here is an explanation of Jenkings <a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/08/jenkins-internal-action-and-its.html">Action and its subtypes</a></li>
<li>You think <i>your</i> CI setup is impressive? Check out <a href="https://builds.apache.org/">the Apache Foundation&#8217;s Jenkins server</a></li>
<li>The easiest way to get CI going is with the ubiquitious but completely unoffically Ant JUnit XML format. <a href="http://www.stevetrefethen.com/blog/Publishing-Python-unit-test-results-in-Jenkins.aspx">Publishing Python unit test results in Jenkins</a> discusses a python package a bit for it.</li>
<li>To me, using a headless browser like HTMLUnit makes very little sense. Now, a headful browser on a headless machine &#8212; that makes sense. <a href="http://iafonov.github.com/blog/setup-jenkins-to-run-headless-selenium.html">Setting up Jenkins CI to run selenium tests and record video in three easy steps</a> explains how to do this in Ruby.</li>
<li><a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/selenium-setup/">Travis CI &#8211; Selenium setup</a> shows the similar thing minus the recording of a video for the Travis CI environment.</li>
<li>So far it seems that one should just subscribe to the Multunus blog and be done with it. Or at least <a href="http://www.multunus.com/blog/all/continuous-delivery/">the continuous delivery category</a>.</li>
<li>Think your web app deployment is &#8216;hard&#8217;? <a href="http://blog.octo.com/en/continuous-delivery-how-do-we-deliver-in-3-clicks-to-7000-machines/">Continuous Delivery: How do we deliver in 3 clicks to 7000 machines?</a> discusses a .NET client application. Now go count your blessings and get that remote svn export scripted.</li>
<li><a href="http://theagileadmin.com/2011/09/12/wont-somebody-please-think-of-the-systems/">Won’t somebody please think of the systems?</a> looks at CI with a bit of an ITIL lens</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.stevemoyer.net/2011/09/distributed-check-in-tokens-pass-puppy.html">Distributed Check-in Tokens: Pass-The-Puppy</a> presents a quick technical solution for not breaking the build through tokens. You could of course talk to each other but there are sometimes time zones conspiring against you.</li>
