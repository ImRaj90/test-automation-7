<p>Is this week&#8217;s post the  Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything Selenium?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/selenium-2---get-number-of-rows-in-a-table/52">Selenium 2 &#8211; Get Number of Rows in a Table</a> illustrates what is advertised, though it feels like there has to be a shorter way to do this along the lines of getXpathCount() or getCssCount()</li>
<li><a href="http://leonardinius.blogspot.com/2011/02/atlassian-plugin-sdk-how-to-provide.html">Atlassian Plugin SDK &#8211; how to provide optional selenium tests</a> explains how to wire up Se with the Atlassian toolkit and has a couple task specific tips as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://jwbito.ballardview.com/2011/02/automated-test-for-facebook-canvas-apps.html">Automated Test for Facebook Canvas Apps – Front-end automation with Selenium</a> is very buzzword compliant: Selenium-WebDriver, Facebook, Canvas. All it needs is to run on a mobile device.</li>
<li>Sauce Labs have released <a href="http://code.google.com/p/se-builder/">Se-Builder</a> which is their interpretation of what a next generation record/playback tool might look like.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m sure I had to know about this already, but <a href="http://www.wakaleo.com/books/continuous-integration-with-hudson-the-book">Jenkins: The Definitive Guide</a> is an open-source book on everyone&#8217;s favourite politically embroiled CI server. Speaking of politics, here is an <a href="http://daniel.gredler.net/2011/02/15/hudson-and-jenkins-two-weeks-later/">interesting graph</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2011/02/15/measure-anything-measure-everything/">Measure Anything, Measure Everything</a> seems pretty cool. Suspect you could do something in your scripts to ping the counter so you could get visualizations of your runs.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/energizedwork/selenium-ide-nle">Se-IDE Natural Language Extension</a> is <i>very</i> cool. Now, if only they had gone the extra step to make it a <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/plugins.html">plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.bettersoftwaretesting.com/?p=16">Pushing the Boundaries of Test Automation</a> is useful if you too are pushing boundaries &#8212; and most people are at least once per application</li>
<li><a href="https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Testing">Lift Testing</a> has an example of writing Se scripts using ScalaTest. Think that is the first time I&#8217;ve seen that.</li>
<li><a href="http://koenwillemse.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/custom-c-formatter-for-selenium/">Custom C# formatter for Selenium</a> details a bit of the journey and links to a formatter that uses <a href="http://fluentassertions.codeplex.com/">Fluent Assertions</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/stephend/archives/2011/02/the_case_for_se.html">The Case for &#8220;Longevity/Endurance&#8221; (Session-Based Testing) in Selenium</a> partially rebuts the single, small, Se script idea. Or at least provides a counter example.</li>
<li>I hack runners for fun, so <a href="http://www.skorks.com/2011/02/a-unit-testing-framework-in-44-lines-of-ruby/">A Unit Testing Framework In 44 Lines Of Ruby</a> has all sorts of geek appeal.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ivaturi.org/home/hackingseleniumtoimproveitsperformanceonie">Hacking Selenium to improve its performance on IE</a> has, well, hacks to improve Se time on IE. These are Se-RC specific, but came up in an Se-WebDriver context.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.xebia.fr/2011/02/18/automatiser-les-tests-selenium-avec-maven/">Automatiser les tests Selenium avec Maven</a> took over the selenium twitter search for a day or so &#8212; which isn&#8217;t that interesting except that it is French. Seems there is an under-served market there. Oh, and Google Translate is horrible on pom.xml examples.</li>
<li><a href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> is another of those things that would be fun to integrate into a Se run</li>
</ul>
