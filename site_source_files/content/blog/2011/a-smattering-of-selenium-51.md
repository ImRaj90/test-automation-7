<p>Two big releases last week..</p>
<ul>
<li>Selenium IDE 1.0.11 was released &#8212; with Firefox 4 support. Finally. And just in time for people to start agitating for Firefox 5 support. <a href="http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/selenium-ide-1-0-11-%E2%80%93-now-with-firefox-4-support/">official announcement</a>, <a href="http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/2011/05/30/welcome-selenium-ide-1-0-11-with-firefox-4-support/">unofficial announcement</a></li>
<li>Selenium 2 RC1 (and RC2) were released which marks the first official release of the new in-server grid behaviour. Even if you are not using the WebDriver API or grid functionality, you should be updating your environment to this. <a href="http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/06/02/selenium-2-0rc2-the-better-working-release/">official announcement</a></li>
<p>And the rest.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/super-considered-super/">Pythonâ€™s super() considered super!</a> begins with <i>If you arenâ€™t wowed by Pythonâ€™s super() builtin, chances are you donâ€™t really know what it is capable of doing or how to use it effectively.</i> and goes from there.</li>
<li>Want to know what the top 100 issues that have been logged for Se according to the number of stars that have been given them? Click <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list?sort=-stars">here</a> and wonder no more</li>
<li>[Successful] automation <i>is</i> code, so <a href="http://blog.ashodnakashian.com/2011/03/code-readability/">Why Code Readability Matters</a> is important. Especially since a large body of people writing automation would not consider themselves programmers so missed a large part of the implicit learnings that comes with it.</li>

</li>
<li><a href="http://22ideastreet.com/blog/2011/06/02/the-state-of-ruby-and-testing/">The State of Ruby and Testing</a> has graphs and such around some survey results around testing in the Ruby community. What is it with Ruby and their love of testing frameworks? ðŸ™‚</li>
<li>The future of testing Se-IDE lies with Mozmill. If you are interested in knowing how to run its own tests see <a href="http://blargon7.com/2011/06/running-the-selenium-ide-mozmill-tests/">Running the Selenium IDE Mozmill tests</a> &#8212; and then start to add your own.</li>
<li>What is the most under-used part of Se you ask? Rollups! Which could be thought of as macros and an example can be found <a href="http://www.practicalweb.co.uk/blog/11/06/02/selenium-ui-elements-rollups">here</a>. Rollups btw, will be moved into an Se-IDE plugin at some point.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eviltester.com/index.php/2011/06/02/how-can-i-learn-to-automate-my-testing-using-selenium/">How can I learn to automate my testing using Selenium?</a> is designed to be Google link-bait and I can&#8217;t help but think that is a good thing. I would probably have switched Step 4 at the bottom to be &#8216;Create Page Objects with the help of the generated code&#8217; or something like that. It&#8217;s not really a &#8216;Best Practice&#8217; to take the raw generated code and run it anymore &#8212; if it ever really was.</li>
<li><i>When most people think of &#8220;the browser&#8217;s cache&#8221; they envision a single map of HTTP requests to HTTP responses on disk (and perhaps partially in memory)</i> from <a href="http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/02/chromes-10-caches.html">Chrome&#8217;s 10 Caches</a> shatters another idea I held. Sigh.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eviltester.com/index.php/2011/06/03/selenium-2-0b2-hey-wheres-my-unashamedly-ugly-wait/">Hey, whereâ€™s my unashamedly ugly wait</a> asks the question, then answers it. Sorta. Of course, the answer is in Java so is <i>still</i> ugly&#8230;</li>
<li>So does Se have a story around Symbian? Asked due to <a href="http://www.comscoredatamine.com/2011/05/top-smartphone-platforms-in-europe/">Top Smartphone Platforms in Europe</a></li>
<li><a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2011/06/depth-and-breadth-of-python.html">The depth and breadth of Python</a> ends with <i>Maybe I should just cancel all weekly meetings and sign off from all mailing lists and focus on two things: meeting Python users and coding.</i> &#8212; more people should do this I think. Well, at least the first part.</li>

<li>Integrating JUnit tests with HP/Mercury Quality Center &#8211; <a href="http://fijiaaron.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/integrating-junit-tests-with-hpmercury-quality-center/">part one</a>, <a href="http://fijiaaron.wordpress.com/2011/06/01/integrating-junit-with-hp-quality-center-part-2/">part two</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/tom_murphy/2011/02/24/the-apple-testing-problem">The Apple Testing Problem</a> raises a good point (from Gartner! I know!) &#8212; of course, they don&#8217;t talk about the cause, which is Apple&#8217;s lack of participation in the outside world. It would be great if they would help with the automation driver for their core browser tech, but so would a lot of things that don&#8217;t seem to be likely.</li>
<li>I usually don&#8217;t link to my own stuff here, but I did a webinar for PustToTest last week and the video of it <a href="http://www.pushtotest.com/selenium-you-are-doing-it-wrong.html">is now online</a>. (Webinars are weird.)</li>
