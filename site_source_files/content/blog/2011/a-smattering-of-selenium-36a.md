<p>I have drastically fallen behind on the link reporting, but not the collecting, so this week&#8217;s Smattering will be multi-part.<br />
<br />
The &#8216;big&#8217; news falls for this edition is two fold &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li>We&#8217;re having a conference! <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.com/">Selenium Conference 2011</a> is April 4 &#8211; 6, 2011 in San Francisco. See the site for more information. (And I think our friends at Watir are going to be in the same space the day before.)</li>
<li>The Betas are here! The Beta&#8217;s are here! As Simon&#8217;s <a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/12/24/selenium-2-0-beta-1-release/">post</a> announced, Selenium 2.0b1 has been released to the [unsuspecting] masses. Everyone, including Se-RC users are encouraged to switch their server over to it &#8212; its backwards compatible with 1.x and has a tonne of important fixes (like the HEAD request on open, -htmlSuite works again, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>
And not to downplay things, but here are the usual assortment of things I think are of interest/value to those automating stuff [with Selenium].</p>
<ul>
<li>Checklists are a Good Thing&trade; when it comes to testing, so why not automation too? So here is a <a href="http://www.bryancook.net/2010/12/unit-test-review-checklist.html">Unit Test Review Checklist</a></li>
<li>ExtJS is one of those things that seems to come up more often than not on the se-users list which makes me think I&#8217;m lucky that none of my clients use it. <a href="http://amiworks.co.in/talk/testing-extjs-application-with-selenium-few-pointers/">Testing Extjs Application With Selenium : Few Pointers</a> seems like it would be useful in such an event though.</li>
<li>Those of us around the automation space for awhile have often heard about Google&#8217;s mythic &#8216;Small, Medium, Large&#8217; scheme for categorizing scripts &#8212; and now <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2010/12/test-sizes.html">they are documented</a>. Combining this idea with tagging of scripts and you&#8217;re laughing.</li>
<li>Looks like IBM is now starting to care about Selenium in developerWorks with <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-webautoselenium/index.html">Automated web testing with Selenium</a> which has an assortment of quick things to help people out. And it is IBM so it got lots of love from folks [bots?] on Twitter.</li>
<li>Personas is something from the UX community that I&#8217;ve started to think more about in terms of what gets automated and/or how the the scripts are organized. The <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/resources/persona-cheat-sheet/">Persona Cheat Sheet</a> will help you start down that road too.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.testingexperience.com/index.php">Testing Experience</a> magazine recently had an Open Source issue which had some interesting articles. Doesn&#8217;t appear to be anything groundbreaking, but my definition of that might be a bit warped.</li>
<li>Oooo! All of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=1242F05D3EA83AB1">GTAC videos</a> in one place. Now you really can pretend you were in India for the week.</li>
<li><a href="http://trishkhoo.com/?p=272">Go faster! Linking data generation to hotkeys</a> is one of those posts that could be quite useful if you use automation to move quickly around a site so you can manually test it.</li>
<li>Selenium IDE 1.0.10 is a &#8216;stable&#8217; version (unlike 1.0.8 and 1.0.9 it seems) but did introduce one change to how element attributes are handled which I documented in <a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/atoms-have-come-to-selenium-ide/">Atoms have come to Selenium IDE</a></li>
<li>Using Python&#8217;s unittest module? Consider upgrading to <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/unittest2.shtml">unittest2</a></li>
