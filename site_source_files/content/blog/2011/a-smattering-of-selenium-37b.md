<p>Let&#8217;s see how many announcements there were that didn&#8217;t get pushed out in a timely manner today shall we?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, there is of course <a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/selenium-conf-is-coming-get-your-proposals-in/">Selenium Conf is coming</a> and you have until Friday to get your proposals in. Last I heard we had 37 which is impressive, but I think 50 should be doable.</li>
<li>On the meetup side of things there is
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Selenium-Users-Group/calendar/15997626/">Boston on January 25</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCSelenium/">NYC on January 26</a> (its not on the site yet, but I&#8217;m speaking, so trust me, it exists)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/seleniumlondon/calendar/16079171/">London on March 23</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://seleniumcamp.com/">SeleniumCamp</a> (<a href="http://translate.google.ca/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fseleniumcamp.com%2F&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=&amp;ie=UTF-8">English</a>) is coming to Kiev at the end of February. Suddenly we go from no &#8216;events&#8217; to lots.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m kinda surprised no one has done this one yet, but a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide-fitnesse-formatte/">FitNesse Formatter</a> plugin for Se-IDE is up on AMO</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/2010/12/28/the-selenium-expert-is-here/">Selenium Expert</a> is a plugin that <i>brings the wonderful world of inspections, tips, hints, fixes and refactoring to Selenese</i>. Samit is a plug-in making machine.</li>
<li>Gorilla Logic have <a href="http://blog.gorillalogic.com/2010/12/16/flexmonkium-4-1-4-released/">have released a new version of FlexMonkium</a> &#8212; with with fully synchronized versioning.</li>
<li><a href="http://seleniumspec.codeplex.com/">SeleniuMspec</a> is a cleverly named formatter for Mspec &#8212; though it isn&#8217;t distributed as an Se-IDE plugin (which would +1 its coolness)</li>
<li>And I quote, <i>Hewlett-Packard (HP) is announcing the discontinuance of HP WinRunner (WR) 7.5, 7.6, 8.0, 8.2, 9.2 (all editions) products.</i>. Is it wrong to say something like &#8216;Ding, dong, the witch is dead&#8217;?. Of course, we wouldn&#8217;t likely be here without WR, but who doesn&#8217;t love some friendly-ish ribbing? Here is he full <a href="http://support.openview.hp.com/encore/wr.jsp">notice</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.getkrypton.com/">Krypton</a> appears to be a cloud service for managing your Se scripts and has a &#8216;we need testers&#8217; box on their site if anyone is curious</li>
<li>And to illustrate that this space seems to have potential, or people think it does at any rate, <a href="http://www.testrunnr.com/">Test Runnr</a> also does cloud based script management with the added feature of running scripts against the <a href="http://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs</a> OnDemand cloud. So if you have a cloud based app that you script with Selenium stored in the cloud and executed in the cloud are you yourself a meta-cloud company?</li>
</ul>
<p>More tomorrow as we dig ourselves out of the hole.</p>
