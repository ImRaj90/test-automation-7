<p>Its been almost a month, so time for a flurry of Smatterings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maven has a bad reputation in some circles (ignoring for a second that you are using Java&#8230;), but should you be using it the <a href="https://github.com/sebarmeli/Selenium2-Java-QuickStart-Archetype">QuickStart Archetype</a> looks interesting.</li>
<li><a href="http://theagileadmin.com/2011/11/15/why-your-monitoring-is-lying-to-you/">Why Your Monitoring Is Lying To You</a> talks about types of logging which are valuable both from a Continuous Delivery perspective and for checking the health of your application during long script runs.</li>
<li>I still maintain that they who nails QC integration with/for Se will get buckets of money from people. Here is one attempt at it: <a href="http://www.one-shore.com/quality-center-integration/">Quality Center Integration</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jessenoller.com/good-to-great-python-reads/">Good to Great Python reads</a> is I think now on my list of things to hand new (and seasoned) Python folks.</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163752.aspx">Test Harness Design Patterns</a> is from 2005 but still interesting.</li>
<li><a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/jacuzzi/0.1.4/frames">jacuzzi</a> is <i>superficial wrapper over RSpec + Capybara + Selenium test setup and execution</i></li>
<li>Because I don&#8217;t already have enough backlog on videos, the <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011-session-abstracts.cb">2011 Jenkins User Conference videos</a> are now online. Though behind a registration wall. I know why companies do this, but boo on you.</li>
<li><i>This</i> is how you publish videos from a conferences &#8211; <a href="http://www.gtac.biz/talks">GTAC 2011</a>. Note that this is how SeConf did it too..</li>
<li><a href="http://itreallymatters.net/post/12242886944/awesome-page-objects-in-testing">Awesome Page Objects In Testing</a> uses Bing as its example to explain Page Objects in Ruby</li>
<li>Ignore the Se-IDE suggestion, but <a href="http://evolvingweb.ca/story/improving-your-drupal-testing-process">Improving Your Drupal Testing Process</a> has an &#8216;assumed to work&#8217; list specifically spelled out. Too often this is not explicitly made &#8212; and agreed upon as acceptable risks by stakeholders</li>
