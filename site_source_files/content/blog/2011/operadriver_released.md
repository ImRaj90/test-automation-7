<p>I think the word that I&#8217;m looking for is &#8220;wow&#8221;. Perhaps &#8220;Wow!&#8221; would express the concept a little more clearly. Perhaps &#8220;WOW!&#8221; would be even clearer.  Yes, definitely. &#8220;WOW!&#8221; is a good way of describing <a href="http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2011/02/09/">this</a>.</p>
<p>Before Christmas, Opera Software announced a <a href="http://my.opera.com/core/blog/operawatir-pre-release">pre-release of OperaWatir</a>, an implementation of the Watir 2 API. What you may not know is that Watir 2 rests on the same WebDriver core as Selenium 2. Today, Opera made the source of the <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver">OperaDriver</a> available on github: <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver">https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver</a></p>
<p>This is “WOW!” It’s the first time a browser manufacturer has released their own implementation of the WebDriver APIs, and it shows how much Opera values test automation. Selenium 2 users now have an easy way to test that their sites work with <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/">Opera</a>.</p>
