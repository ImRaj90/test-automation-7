<p>The ChromeDriver is composed of two major pieces. There are the client APIs, which you use in your tests, and there&#8217;s a server part, which the client APIs know how to start and run and which takes the form of an executable called &#8220;chromedriver&#8221;. The server piece is maintained by the Chromium team, and they&#8217;ve just released a new version, with support for Chrome 14 and with bug fixes. If you&#8217;re using Selenium 2.0rc3 and you&#8217;re also using the ChromeDriver, head over to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/downloads/list">Chromium project&#8217;s download page</a> for the latest and greatest!</p>
