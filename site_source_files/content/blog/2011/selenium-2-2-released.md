<p>The feedback from the last release was heard loud and clear: little and often it is!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re proud to announce the release of <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">Selenium 2.2</a>. What&#8217;s new this time? For many users, this is simply a bug fix release as there are no new major features. One thing you might appreciate is <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/IllegalLocatorException.html">better exceptions</a> being thrown when xpath searches return something other than a web element when using the WebDriver APIs, and we&#8217;re continuing to tweak the emulation of user events.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a .Net user, there is now an official<a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Selenium.WebDriver"> NuGet package</a>, and if you&#8217;re a maven user then rest assured the release is heading to the central repo as quickly as we can manage.</p>
