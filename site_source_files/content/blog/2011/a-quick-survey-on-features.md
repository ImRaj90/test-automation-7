<p>Rather than surprising the general community in ways that we have become somewhat known for, I figured I would try something new. Actually asking about usage of things before changing them in fundamental ways.</p>
<p>To this end, I have created a quick(!) <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DZC89TF">survey</a> about changes that are under consideration regarding UI-Maps and how Se-IDE is opened.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DZC89TF">survey</a> is only two questions, so I&#8217;m hoping for a large response. I&#8217;ll post the results next Monday (August 8, 2011).</p>
<p>One more time for good luck, the survey is over <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DZC89TF">here</a>.</p>
