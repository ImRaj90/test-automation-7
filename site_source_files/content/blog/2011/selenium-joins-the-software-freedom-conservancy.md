<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem that long ago that we announced on the mailing list that the Selenium project planned to join the <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>. I&#8217;m very pleased to announce that as of Friday, 21st January, our application was approved. We&#8217;re now under the aegis of the SFC.</p>
<p>From most people&#8217;s perspective, this won&#8217;t make much difference: you&#8217;ll still be able to view the documentation and download the latest versions of Selenium from <a href="http://seleniumhq.org">Selenium HQ</a>. Development will continue to use <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/">Google Code&#8217;s</a> code hosting and issue tracking. We are now, however, part of a formal non-profit organization, which means that a number of issues, such as how to handle revenues from adverts on our sites, become clearer and more transparent.</p>
<p>There are more details about what this means in the <a title="Selenium Joins the Software Freedom Conservancy" href="http://sfconservancy.org/news/2011/feb/02/selenium-joins/">SFC&#8217;s announcement</a> and their list of <a title="SFC Member Project Services" href="http://sfconservancy.org/members/services/">membership benefits</a>. The bottom line is that this is a major milestone in Selenium&#8217;s growth and ensures that as we continue to grow our user base and introduce new features and projects, we&#8217;ll have strong support and backing from a well-respected Open Source organization.</p>
