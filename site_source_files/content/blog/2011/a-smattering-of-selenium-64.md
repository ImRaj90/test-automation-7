<p>How did I fall behind again already?!?!</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a pretty good deck. <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/jimholmes/p/automation-isnt-all-shiny-toys">Automation Isn&#8217;t All Shiny Toys</a></li>
<li>If your work is divided in time-based goals then providing videos of the end result is a fantastic idea. See Dave&#8217;s <a href="http://blargon7.com/2011/10/q32011-in-review/">Q3/2011 in review</a>. The last two screencasts directly relate to Se</li>
<li><a href="http://aslakhellesoy.com/post/11055981222/the-training-wheels-came-off">The training wheels came off</a> is outstanding! I&#8217;ve been saying this around Se-IDE for years.</li>
<li>If you have tried automation-in-anger with Python, then you have likely spent some time swearing at the GIL. Thankfully David Beazley finds the GIL &#8216;fun&#8217; and has posted some slides about it. <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/talks/EmbraceGIL/EmbracingGIL.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dabeaz/in-search-of-the-perfect-global-interpreter-lock">here</a>. Such geeky fun.</li>
<li>Feature Switching is an important concept to get your development team wrapped around if doing automation; <a href="http://www.paulstack.co.uk/blog/post/feature-switching-a-better-way-to-collaborate.aspx">Feature switching: a better way to collaborate</a> even has a common project feature-switch-inated linked to at the end.</li>
<li>Another important thing is hosting your own respository of build artifacts. <a href="http://www.build-doctor.com/2011/10/10/repository-thats-not-a-repository/">Repository? That’s not a repository</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twist4all.wordpress.com/2011/05/21/logging-selenium-2-events-in-twist/">Logging Selenium 2 Events in Twist</a> is a product centric spike report &#8212; but is a good read if you want to extend WebDriver</li>
<li>This &#8216;Learn your tools&#8217; reminder is brought to you by <a href="http://blakesmith.me/2011/10/14/diving-down-the-stack.html">diving down the stack</a></li>
<li>Automated configuration management with Puppet? <a href="https://github.com/cloudsmith/geppetto">Geppetto</a> seems to be an important addition to that toolset.</li>
