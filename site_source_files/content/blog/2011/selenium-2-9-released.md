<p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">Selenium 2.9</a>. As well as improving the stability of Grid under high loads, we&#8217;ve added an experimental (and temporary!) feature that allows the Firefox driver to use a different mechanism for determining when a page is loaded. This is designed to handle the case where the driver appears to hang, as it&#8217;s waiting for all incoming requests to complete before continuing. How to enable this mode is listed in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/CHANGELOG">changelog</a>.</p>
<p>This release also includes an updated <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=android-server-2.9.apk">Android driver</a>, allowing your tests to run on Ice Cream Sandwich devices.</p>
