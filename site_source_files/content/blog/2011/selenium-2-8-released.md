<p>In keeping with our (roughly) weekly releases, Selenium 2.8 was <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">released today</a> (and on Maven too), <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/CHANGELOG">with a *huge* list of bug-fixes</a>!  As well as improved stability, if you&#8217;re using the Java API, this release adds the ability to upload files to a RemoteWebDriver server (see <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebDriver.html#setFileDetector(org.openqa.selenium.remote.FileDetector)">RemoteWebDriver.setFileDetector</a>).</p>
<p>Particular thanks have to go out to our two newest committers, Alexei Barancev and Ajay Kemparaj, for the copious bug-fixes they&#8217;ve contributed!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re already hard at work getting 2.9 ready for next week with even more more bug-fixes &#8211; watch this space!</p>
