<p>My scheme for catching up with links last week ran afoul of 900 geeks and their families melting the internets at <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash 2.0.1.1</a>. So let&#8217;s try it again this week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Capturing screenshots on script failure is a common trick and <a href="http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/capturing-web-page-screenshots-with-selenium-2/48">Capturing Web Page Screenshots with Selenium 2</a> is the first post I have seen that explains how to do with with Selenium WebDriver</li>
<li><a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2011/01/selenium-xpath-marks-the-spot/">XPath marks the spot</a> uses a treasure map analogy around how to create good XPath &#8212; but at the same time propagates the &#8216;XPath is Inherently Evil&#8217; myth. I intentionally don&#8217;t link to myself nearly as much as I could, but think that my comment in the post is important.</li>
<li><a href="http://manbuildswebsite.com/2010/12/20/domain-test-values/">Unit Test Patterns: The Domain Test Values Class</a> describes a pattern to <i>provide values used in the testing of a domain in a way which improves understanding of test code by increasing readability and adding meaning to values.</i></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tlrobinson/leakhelper">leakhelper</a> is another of those tools that could be cool to integrate into your Se scripts. And if you do, don&#8217;t forget to document it and point it out to me&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/devtools/2010/12/missiles-failed-builds-bamboo-punisher.html">Missiles + Failed Builds = Bamboo Punisher</a> &#8212; actually, its a crazy high level of awesome</li>
<li><a href="http://www.michaeldkelly.com/archives/548">Software Testing Lightning Talks from IWST</a> includes some on automation at the end &#8212; but lots of good non-automation ones as well</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2010/12/testing-smartgwt-applications-with-selenium-and-robot-framework/">Testing SmartGWT Applications with Selenium and Robot Framework</a> is more Robot Framework goodness including <i>Add some meaningful ID&#8217;s to your code</i> &#8212; which is actually for SmartGWT but makes life <u>so</u> much easier</li>
<li>The author of Selenium Simplified compares his book to Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools in <a href="http://www.eviltester.com/index.php/2010/12/29/so-now-you-have-a-choice-of-selenium-testing-books-and-ebooks/">So now you have a choice of Selenium Testing books and ebooks</a> is a pretty fair and well-reasoned article. (Short version: buy both)</li>
<li>We can&#8217;t go a couple months without someone rediscovering the joys of sending text to the browser. This time it is <a href="http://blog.projectdirigible.com/?p=671">Functional testing with Selenium: issues with selenium.type, javascript events and keyPressNative</a> but has the additional twist of including a solution in code and not just whinging.</li>
<li>If you are a .NET developer, then <a href="http://www.bryancook.net/2011/01/selenium-toolkit-for-net-084-released.html">Selenium Toolkit for .NET 0.84 Released</a> might be of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>And assuming I remembered to pay the internet bill, there will be more links tomorrow.</p>
