Of course, Watir can use WebDriver so they didn&#8217;t <i>have</i> to port their scripts to a different API (I sure hope they have the API well abstracted away from their scripts). And of course the title of the post implies that Facebook thinks that Watir/Selenium scripts are &#8216;Unit&#8217; tests which is suspect at best&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rtyler/jenkins-selenium-tests">Selenium tests for Jenkins</a> &#8212; Yup; Jenkins now has a set of Se scripts for it. Fork, modify and sent pull requests.</li>

<li><a href="http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/2011/09/30/managing-locator-builders-in-selenium-ide/">Managing Locator Builders in Selenium IDE</a> introduces a new feature that we snuck into the most recent version of Se-IDE. Still needs a bit of polish, but we&#8217;re getting there.</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.codekills.net/2011/09/29/the-evils-of--except--">The evils of `except:`</a> is a good reminder about naked excepts in your code. Doubly true in automation where you <i>really</i> want to have exceptions bubbling to the top.</li>
