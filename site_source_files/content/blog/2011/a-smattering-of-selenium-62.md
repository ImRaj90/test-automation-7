<p>All opinions, all the time&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>It all began with <a href="http://angryweasel.com/blog/?p=325">Test Design for Automation</a> which lead to <a href="http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/automated-test-design-riffingripping.html">Automated Test Design (riffing/ripping off Alan Page)</a></li>
<li>And then through some weird Jedi mind control there was <a href="http://angryweasel.com/blog/?p=332">Design for *GUI* Automation</a> which in turn led to <a href="http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/more-ui-test-design-once-more-from-alan.html">more UI test design (once more from Alan Page)</a></li>
<li>And heck, why have two articles from the same author when you can have three?! <a href="http://angryweasel.com/blog/?p=342">It’s (probably) a Design Problem</a> &#8212; though I don&#8217;t think Chris has riffed off this one yet&#8230;</li>
<li>Remember, <a href="http://blogs.telerik.com/jimholmes/posts/11-09-22/not-every-test-should-be-automated.aspx">Not Every Test Should be Automated!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2011/09/22/dependency-injection-is-not-the-same-as-the-dependency-inversion-principle/">Dependency Injection Is NOT The Same As The Dependency Inversion Principle</a> &#8212; not that I really understand either really&#8230;</li>
<li>Who knew a collection of scrapebookers is called a &#8216;crop&#8217;? Also, a &#8216;scrapbooking consultant&#8217;? &#8212; automation is hard, let&#8217;s go scrapbooking! Anyways, <a href="http://blog.aclairefication.com/2011/09/taking-on-water/">Taking on Water</a> is dead on in terms of which things to prioritize when automating.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/autosqa.pdf">Improving the Maintainability of Automated Test Suites</a> by Cem Kaner is an older paper, but the Strategies for Success on page 3 are important. Especially 1, 2 and 5.</li>
<li>Also from the vaults is <a href="http://cafe.elharo.com/testing/harolds-corollary-to-knuths-law/">Harold’s Corollary to Knuth’s Law</a> which is aimed at Unit not Functional tests, but still is food for thought.</li>

<li><a href="http://thetesteye.com/blog/2011/09/the-little-black-book-on-test-design/">The Little Black Book on Test Design</a> is meant for exploratory testing, but I bet there is stuff one could pull out of it for automation purposes as well.</li>
