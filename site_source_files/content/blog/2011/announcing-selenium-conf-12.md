<p>The community around Selenium is the thing that really makes the Selenium project special. Last year, we held the first official Selenium Conference in San Francisco, and it was both great fun and a huge success. It is therefore with great pleasure that we are announcingÂ <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/">Selenium Conf &#8217;12</a>! It&#8217;ll be taking place in <strong>London</strong> from the<strong> 16th to the 18th April</strong>, and we&#8217;re really looking forward to seeing you all there!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been followingÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/seleniumconf">@seleniumconf</a>Â on Twitter, you probably already know that we have some <a href="http://seconf2012.eventbrite.com/">early bird tickets</a>Â available andÂ theÂ <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/">Call for Papers</a> is open. We&#8217;re looking for everything from lighting talks, through traditional presentations, to half-day long workshops on anything that uses Selenium in any way, including building on the Selenium WebDriver APIs (so talks about Watir would be welcome too!). It&#8217;ll be a chance to show off what you know and learn from the experts. If you get a quiet moment during the Christmas break, why not put <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/">forward a talk</a>? If you&#8217;re not a talker, but can help us with <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/sponsors/">sponsorship</a>, we&#8217;d love to hear from you too!</p>
<p>Just as last year, the workshops will be happening on the first day of the conference, but places are limited. We plan on running a total of four workshops across two tracks, meaning each workshop is half a day long; a fantastic opportunity to take a deep dive into a particular area of the project.Â The early bird tickets give you access to them, as well as the conference itself on the 17th and 18th.</p>
<p>The conference will consist of a main single track with selected speakers, with break out rooms being dedicated to an unconference, the contents of which will be decided by attendees. It&#8217;ll be your conference, help us make it brilliant ðŸ™‚</p>
