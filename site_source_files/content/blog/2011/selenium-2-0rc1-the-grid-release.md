<p>We&#8217;re very happy to announce the first Release Candidate for Selenium 2, available for Java, C#, Ruby and Python. The API has been stabilised and the functionality needed for the final 2.0 release is mostly in. Weâ€™re going to be working hard to get there as soon as possible, but nowâ€™s the perfect time to test the waters and provide us with any feedback you may have! <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list">Grab the downloads from the site</a>!</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2">Grid 2</a>: A major feature of this release is Grid 2, an implementation of the Selenium Grid that supports WebDriver&#8217;s wire protocol, allowing tests using Selenium WebDriver to be distributed through it. There are someÂ <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2">docs to help you get started</a>Â on the wiki.</li>
<li>New <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver">ChromeDriver</a>: Following a complete rewrite of the ChromeDriver, Selenium 2 is now supported natively by the Chrome browser itself. In order to use this, you must download the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list">chromedriver executable</a> from the Selenium project site.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/operadriver/">OperaDriver</a> support: We&#8217;ve bundled the most excellent OperaDriver into the release to make it easy to get started testing with <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">Opera</a>.</li>
<li>Support for native events in Firefox 4.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AdvancedUserInteractions">Advanced User Interactions</a>: An API that allows you to model complex user interactions, such as clicking on an element, holding the shift key, clicking on three more, and then dragging the four elements to a final destination. The entry point to this API is the <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/Actions.html">Actions</a> class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Weâ€™ve also deleted all methods that were deprecated in 2.0b3 and have marked a number of methods and classes (notably <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/RenderedWebElement.html">RenderedWebElement</a> and <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#getValue()">WebElement.getValue</a>) deprecated. These will be deleted in the next release.</p>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native events on Linux may not work properly on tests that include alerts and prompts.</li>
<li>Mouse actions using the Advanced User Interactions API may not work properly for elements that have to be scrolled into view.</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan on making our releases more frequent in the run up to 2.0final and polish off the bugs and issues. Stay tuned! This is going to be fun ðŸ™‚</p>
