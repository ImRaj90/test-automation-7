<li>I haven&#8217;t read it, but <a href="http://www.ryber.se/?p=213">Essential Software Testdesign</a> is now available for free [legitimately] as a pdf</a>. Test Design is something I expect to see more discussion around in 2011 when it comes to Se automation. The rules really are different here.</li>

<li>Removing -htmlSuite from the Selenium Server and replacing it with a &#8216;real&#8217; runner is something I&#8217;ve been thinking about recently after seeing <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=175">	[PROPOSAL] Webdriver Selenese HTML Runner</a>. Who else has done this? Let&#8217;s see/share the code.</li>
<li>I was babbling on about Page Objects on Twitter and was sent a video on &#8216;BDD, ATDD and Page Object&#8217;. Haven&#8217;t had time to see it yet, but you might.<br />

<li>Another <a href="http://agilesoftwaretesting.com/?p=143">Selenium Auto Accept Self Signed SSL Certificates and Basic Authentication</a> post, but this time with a Ruby bias for those who insist on having SSL turned on in environments other than production. (WHY?)</li>
<li>And from the same person, <a href="http://agilesoftwaretesting.com/?p=166">Testing PDF files with (and without) Selenium</a> which is outstandingly cool. I know of at least one client who needed this a year ago.</li>
