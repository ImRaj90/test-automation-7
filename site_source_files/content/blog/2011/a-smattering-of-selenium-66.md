<p>Aside from one of the dog&#8217;s tummy making noises that imply a big mess to clean up later, this scheduling thing seems to be working out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heard someone talk about doing bitmap comparisons last week somewhere. <a href="http://adaptive-images.com/">Adaptive Images</a> tricks I suspect are going to become more commonplace. Good luck with that. Se is best at interaction, structure and content checks; not does-it-look-the-way-some-human-intended. Robots where robots should be used. Humans where humans should be used.</li>

<p><i>Integration tests <b>can</b> be brittle if they know too much about how those components work. Proper integration tests use your application as a black box. They should know as little as possible about what happens under the hood, they’re just there to observe and interact with the interface.</i></p>

<li>I seem to think I already posted this, but the search isn&#8217;t finding anything. Here is a visualization of the commits to Se.<br />

<li>The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleWebmasterHelp">GoogleWebmasterHelp</a> channel on YouTube is full of ideas that you could include in your scripts. At least from an SEO perspective. And Google SEO at that.</li>
<li>The theme this week seems to be GIL. So here is <a href="http://merbist.com/2011/10/03/about-concurrency-and-the-gil/">About concurrency and the GIL</a> which for once is about Ruby.</li>
<li>The whole &#8216;Facebook switching from Watir&#8217; thing produced at least one good rebuttal; <a href="http://itreallymatters.net/post/10991877834/facebook-watir-and-testing">Facebook, Watir And Testing</a></li>
