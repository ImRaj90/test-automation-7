<p>What started out as the week of Capybara rounded itself out fairly nicely</p>
<li>I&#8217;m not a fan of using 3rd party abstraction layers (1st party are full win though) but Capybara has a large marketshare so <a href="http://opinionated-programmer.com/2011/02/capybara-and-selenium-with-rspec-and-rails-3">Capybara (and Selenium) with RSpec &amp; Rails 3: quick tutorial</a> is likely going to be of interest to people.</li>
<li>And while on the subject of Capybara, here is a post on <a href="http://testobsessed.com/2011/03/01/checking-invisible-elements/">Checking Invisible Elements</a> in it.</li>
<li>Keeping with the Capybara theme, we have <a href="http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2011/03/configuring-user-agents-with-capybara-selenium-webdriver/">Configuring User Agents with Capybara + Selenium Webdriver</a></li>
<li><a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/krzysztof_kozmic/archive/2011/02/28/unit-tests-are-overrated.aspx">Unit tests are overrated</a> is a nice reminder to change <i>all</i> the tests in a system for a change &#8212; not just the unit ones. (C&#8217;mon, how many of us haven&#8217;t been burned and/or responsible for this.)</li>

<p><i>Successful test automation uses good tests that provide clear test results. A pass or no-pass result must be confident and trustworthy. By focusing on what the system should do rather than how it does it, this can be achieved easily and without breaking existing test cases whenever the logic of the system is changed.</i></li>

<li><a href="https://community.dynatrace.com/community/display/PUB/How+to+include+dynaTrace+in+your+Selenium+Tests">How to include dynaTrace in your Selenium Tests</a> is an interesting idea. Would be even better using Page Objects that were controlled externally so you don&#8217;t have to modify working scripts to enable/disable timings. But that&#8217;s an exercise for the reader to do. (Oh, and if their marketing firm wasn&#8217;t tweeting about it every day, that would be keen too.)</li>
