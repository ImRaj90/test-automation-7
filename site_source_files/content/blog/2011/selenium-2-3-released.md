<p>Continuing our new tradition of weekly releases, we&#8217;re very pleased to announce the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">release of Selenium 2.3</a>. The release notes for this version are pretty slim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better detection of clickable areas in Firefox.</li>
<li>Merge of Google-contributed code into the underlying javascript libraries used by the drivers.</li>
</ul>
<div>We&#8217;ve also fixed bugs, one of which was being a nuisance for users of IBM&#8217;s JRE. The complete changelog can be found in the zipped downloads or in <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/java/CHANGELOG">our source tree</a>.</div>
<div>If you&#8217;re a Chrome user, then it&#8217;s a great idea to head over to the<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/downloads/list"> Chromium project&#8217;s download page</a> to pick up the executable used by the ChromeDriver. It&#8217;s recently been updated, and now includes support for handling alerts and prompts! Thanks, Google!</div>
