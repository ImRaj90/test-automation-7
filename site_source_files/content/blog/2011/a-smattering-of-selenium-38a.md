<p>No. Really. I&#8217;m almost caught up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Want input in a non-english language but don&#8217;t want to convert your whole machine? <a href="http://inputking.com/">InputKing</a> might be able to help. And the fact it is in a browser means we can use it via Se.</li>
<li>HAR (HTTP Archive) is the format the cool kids are talking about, and now there is a <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/har">har gem</a> so you can make use of HAR files in you [Ruby] scripts.</li>
<li>Organizing scripts by tagging them is one bandwagon I got on last year to great success and while I don&#8217;t really live in the MS toolset, <a href="http://blog.simontimms.com/2011/01/test-categories-for-mstest.html">Test Categories for MSTest</a> is likely how how I would do it MSTest.</li>
<li>Selenium won an award! Again! See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7aQbi2N0g">the video of Se winning &#8216;Best Open Source Functional Automated Test Tool&#8217;</a></li>
<li>How a script is named is a reflection of the person who wrote it, in <a href="http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/unit-test-naming-convention/">Unit Test Naming Convention</a> one such style is described and the reasoning explained. Just ignore the second half of the summary&#8217;s first sentence though.</li>
<li>Michael Larson is Working his way though <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/selenium-1-0-testing-tools-beginners-guide/book">Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools Beginners Guide</a> and documenting it in a series of blog posts he is calling <a href="http://mkl-testhead.blogspot.com/search/label/PRACTICUM">a practicum</a></li>
<li>Most people use Se to create a regression security blanked, but it there are some points to be discussed around <a href="http://investigatingsoftware.blogspot.com/2010/12/arrogance-of-regression-testing.html">the arrogance of regression testing</a></li>
<li>ATDD continues to mature and the results of two different pattern workshops <a href="http://www.managing-expectations.com/?p=1326">have now been posted</a>. If you are using Cucumber, RobotFramework, Fitnesse, etc. you might want to pay attention.</li>
<li>It always saddens me a bit when large threads pop up <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&amp;srchtype=discussedNews&amp;gid=961927&amp;item=38882290&amp;type=member&amp;trk=EML_anet_ac_pst_ttle">on how to manage Se scripts</a>. It&#8217;s called version control kids. But I realize I&#8217;m an outlier on this.</li>
<li>I suspect a lot of Se folks have a similar tale to <a href="http://blog.abakas.com/2011/01/how-i-learned-to-code.html">How I Learned To Code</a></li>
</ul>
