<p>It&#8217;s been about 5 weeks since the release of beta 2, so we&#8217;re very pleased to announce that Selenium 2.0b3 has just been released simultaneously for Java, .Net, Ruby and Python. You can <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">download it from Selenium HQ</a> or from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list">Google Code site</a>. This release focused on providing excellent support for the next generation of browsers, particularly IE 9 and Firefox 4, and we think you&#8217;ll like what you&#8217;ll find.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restructured documentation at<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/"> Selenium HQ</a></li>
<li>An improved user interaction API
<ul>
<li>Including experimental IME support on Windows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alerts and prompts handling for IE.</li>
<li>Marked the following APIs as obsolete in .Net:
<ul>
<li>IRenderedWebElement.Hover()</li>
<li>IOptions.Speed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even more improvements to the Java webdriver-backed selenium
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ll document the migration path before 2.0b4 is out!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A significantly faster <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/android-server-2.0b3.apk">Android Driver</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As well as these changes, there&#8217;s also the regular clutch of bug fixes and tweaks. For the number crunchers, there were a total of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/list?num=331&amp;start=11749">331 changes</a> that landed in the 5 weeks since the last release, with the 5 most active contributors working on each of the different languages supported by Selenium.</p>
<p>In addition to the enormous thanks that go to the developers, I&#8217;d like to add a big thank you to the Mozilla engineers who chipped in on the IRC channel at the last minute to help us work through some issues with Core. We&#8217;d not have been able to get this release out when we did without their help. Thank you Mozilla!</p>
<p>The next release will be focused on stabilization work, reducing our bug count and adding support for Grid 2.0.</p>
