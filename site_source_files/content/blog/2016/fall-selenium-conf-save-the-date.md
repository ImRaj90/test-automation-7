<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce that we&#8217;ve finally determined where and when Selenium Conf will be happening this Fall.</p>
<p>Our initial goal was to bring the event to a new country, but for a number of reasons that proved more challenging than we&#8217;d hoped. But in 2012 we had the 2nd annual Selenium Conf in London, and we&#8217;re pleased to be bringing it back there this year!</p>
<p>The conference will be held at The Mermaid in downtown London on November 14-16:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 14th will be all-day pre-conference workshops</li>
<li>The 15th-16th will be the conference</li>
</ul>
<p>Go <a href="http://seleniumconf.co.uk/" target="_blank">here</a> to sign up for the email list for conference updates (e.g., when tickets go on sale) as well as submit a talk. Call for speakers are open from now until July 29th.</p>
