            In this page you can find the description and explanations to some common exceptions in WebDriver.

<div class="section dark-background">
    <h2 id="invalid_selector_exception">Invalid Selector</h2>
    <p>This section describes why you might be seeing the InvalidSelectorError (or similar).</p>
    <h3>Common Causes</h3>
    <p>The CSS or xPath selector you are trying to use...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>has invalid characters <em>or</em></li>
        <li>has an invalid query</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Common Examples of the problem</h3>
    A CSS selector with the following query: <pre>* >>> #canvas div.bwu-datagrid-row div.bwu-datagrid-cell.l0</pre>
    is invalid because <blockquote>Unexpected token '&gt;' at column 4</blockquote>
    <h3>Common Solutions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Run your selector through a validator service
            (<a href="http://csslint.net/">CSS Validator</a>|<a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xpath-tester.html">xPath Validator</a>)
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2 id="no_such_element">No Such Element</h2>
    <p>This section describes why you might be seeing the NoSuchElementException (or similar).</p>
    <h3>Common Causes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The element may not be present.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Common Solutions</h3>
</div>

<div class="section dark-background">
    <h2 id="stale_element_reference">Stale Element Reference Exception</h2>
    <p>You have probably been directed to this page because you've seen a StaleElementReferenceException in your tests.</p>
    <h3>Common Causes</h3>
    <p>A stale element reference exception is thrown in one of two cases, the first being more common than the second:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The element has been deleted entirely.</li>
        <li>The element is no longer attached to the DOM.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Element has been Deleted</h4>

    <p>
        The most frequent cause of this is that page that the element was part of has been refreshed, or the user has<br>
        navigated away to another page. A less common, but still common cause is where a JS library has deleted an element<br>
        and replaced it with one with the same ID or attributes. In this case, although the replacement elements may look<br>
        identical they are different; the driver has no way to determine that the replacements are actually what's expected.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the element has been replaced with an identical one, a useful strategy is to look up the element again. If you<br>
        do this automatically, be aware that you may well be opening your tests to a race condition and potential flakiness.<br>
        For example, given the code:
    </p>

    <pre class="code">
    WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("example"));
    String text = element.getText();
    </pre>

    <p>
        If <code>element.getText</code> returns before the element is removed from the DOM you'll get one result.<br>
        If, however, the element is removed from the DOM and your code does an automatic lookup for the element again<br>
        before <code>element.getText</code> a different result may be returned.
    </p>

    <p>
        Should you wish to head down this route, the simplest hook point is to call
        <a href="https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebDriver.html#setElementConverter(org.openqa.selenium.remote.internal.JsonToWebElementConverter)">
            setElementConverter</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>The Element is not Attached to the DOM</h4>

    <p>
        A common technique used for simulating a tabbed UI in a web app is to prepare DIVs for each tab, but only attach<br>
        one at a time, storing the rest in variables. In this case, it's entirely possible that your code might have a reference<br>
        to an element that is no longer attached to the DOM (that is, that has an ancestor which is &quot;document.documentElement&quot;).
    </p>
    <p>
        If WebDriver throws a stale element exception in this case, even though the element still exists, the reference<br>
        is lost. You should discard the current reference you hold and replace it, possibly by locating the element again<br>
        once it is attached to the DOM.
    </p>

    <h3>Edge Cases</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The element changes type, but keeps the same locator sematics (JQuery and others)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The element changes type, but keeps the same locator sematics (JQuery and others)</h4>

    <p>
        Watermarked fields in JQuery change from a regular input to a password field as they get focus. The first end-user<br>
        key press arrives in the password variant. <br>
        Refer to pwField2 in <a href="http://regression-tests.seleniumhq.org/issues/2915.groovy">this example</a>
