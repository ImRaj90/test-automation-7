            The Selenium Project is formed by a community of users and Open Source contributors
            who develop, use and promote the different Selenium projects (IDE, Grid, WebDriver)
            and other related activities, with the end goal of benefiting the community as a whole.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Selenium Project wants as much as possible to operate using procedures that
            are fair, open, inviting, and ultimately good for the community. We want to make
            sure that no matter who you are, you have the opportunity to contribute to Selenium.
            <br>

            This page provides some links to pages describing the project structure and its governance.
