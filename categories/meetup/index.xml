      <description>Note from Adam: This is a guest post from Dave Haeffner who, along with David Burns hatched this idea at SeConf2013.
Selenium Meetups are great, but&amp;#8230;
Have you ever wanted to attend a Selenium Meetup but there&amp;#8217;s not one near you? Or maybe there is but something&amp;#8217;s come up and you can&amp;#8217;t make it out that night? Or maybe the meetup near you struggles to get good speakers and have a consistent schedule?</description>
