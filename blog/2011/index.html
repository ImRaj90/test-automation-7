            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/announcing-selenium-conf-12/"><h2>Announcing Selenium Conf ’12</h2></a>
            <p>The community around Selenium is the thing that really makes the Selenium project special. Last year, we held the first official Selenium Conference in San Francisco, and it was both great fun and a huge success. It is therefore with great pleasure that we are announcing <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/">Selenium Conf &#8217;12</a>! It&#8217;ll be taking place in <strong>London</strong> from the<strong> 16th to the 18th April</strong>, and we&#8217;re really looking forward to seeing you all there!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been following <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/seleniumconf">@seleniumconf</a> on Twitter, you probably already know that we have some <a href="http://seconf2012.eventbrite.com/">early bird tickets</a> available and the <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/">Call for Papers</a> is open. We&#8217;re looking for everything from lighting talks, through traditional presentations, to half-day long workshops on anything that uses Selenium in any way, including building on the Selenium WebDriver APIs (so talks about Watir would be welcome too!). It&#8217;ll be a chance to show off what you know and learn from the experts. If you get a quiet moment during the Christmas break, why not put <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/speakers/">forward a talk</a>? If you&#8217;re not a talker, but can help us with <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.org/sponsors/">sponsorship</a>, we&#8217;d love to hear from you too!</p>
<p>Just as last year, the workshops will be happening on the first day of the conference, but places are limited. We plan on running a total of four workshops across two tracks, meaning each workshop is half a day long; a fantastic opportunity to take a deep dive into a particular area of the project. The early bird tickets give you access to them, as well as the conference itself on the 17th and 18th.</p>
<p>The conference will consist of a main single track with selected speakers, with break out rooms being dedicated to an unconference, the contents of which will be decided by attendees. It&#8217;ll be your conference, help us make it brilliant 🙂</p>

<li>As we start to transistion the web over the HTML5, I keep thinking about incorporating some &#8216;static&#8217; checks into Se scripts. <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2011/11/html5-accessibility-chops-using-nested-figure-elements/">HTML5 Accessibility Chops: using nested figure elements</a> explains some good (and bad) ways to use &lt;figure&gt;</li>

I really like the separation of <i>execution</i> and <i>organization</i> which is not something I had explicitly thought about before.</li>

<li>For TestMate / Java folks, <a href="https://github.com/jrock2004/TextMate-Bundle-Selenium-Java">TextMate-Bundle-Selenium-Java</a> could be interesting.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve all made Oopses when writing / interpreting  Se scripts, so it is important to remember that <a href="http://spin.atomicobject.com/2011/11/18/mistakes-transparency-is-best">Mistakes: Transparency is Best</a></li>
<li>Organizing scripts is one of those topics that gets both too much and not enough attention. <a href="http://blogs.telerik.com/testing/posts/11-11-21/organizing-your-tests.aspx">Organizing Your Tests</a> adds to the discussion &#8212; though completely omits using &#8216;tags&#8217; (which his product supports&#8230;)</li>
<li>Not sure how this will affect automation of Android or not, but still pretty cool.<br />

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-9-released/"><h2>Selenium 2.9 Released</h2></a>
            <p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce the release of <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">Selenium 2.9</a>. As well as improving the stability of Grid under high loads, we&#8217;ve added an experimental (and temporary!) feature that allows the Firefox driver to use a different mechanism for determining when a page is loaded. This is designed to handle the case where the driver appears to hang, as it&#8217;s waiting for all incoming requests to complete before continuing. How to enable this mode is listed in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/CHANGELOG">changelog</a>.</p>
<p>This release also includes an updated <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=android-server-2.9.apk">Android driver</a>, allowing your tests to run on Ice Cream Sandwich devices.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;ve been lead to believe that <a href="http://community.jboss.org/en/arquillian/blog/2011/09/17/functional-testing-with-arquillian">Functional Testing with Arquillian</a> is a Big Deal&amp;tm;. Of course, I just see a lot of Java&#8230;</li>

If you start running scripts in parallel, this, and the GIL is something to keep in mind.</li>
<li>My favourite part of posts like <a href="http://blogs.telerik.com/jimholmes/posts/11-10-15/using-test-oracles-to-ensure-your-tests-rsquo-true-validity.aspx">Using Test Oracles to Ensure Your Tests’ True Validity</a> is they always have a &#8216;this is how I learned this the hard way&#8217; story in them.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m getting more and more convinced that the route to WebDriver powah! is through the JavascriptExecutor. As illustrated in <a href="http://paulhammant.com/2011/09/30/setContext-back-for-selenium2/">setContext(..) is back for Selenium2 😛</a></li>
<li>One important trick to maven is knowing how / where to bind server control to. <a href="http://blog.synyx.de/2011/10/testing-webapp-startup-on-jenkins-with-maven-tomcat-and-web-driver/">Testing webapp startup on Jenkins using Maven, Tomcat and Web Driver</a> might be a bit grand a title, and is using HTMLUnit (why?! do your customers use that browser? really?) but illustrates the maven part well.</li>

<li>And since we&#8217;re critiquing the HTML, why not how the database schema is designed and its impacts on API design. <a href="http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2011/09/24/identifiers-are-not-numbers/">Identifiers are not numbers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/antecedent/patchwork">Patchwork</a> is a library that lets you monkey patch in PHP. Haven&#8217;t found a need for it yet, but I keep thinking I will.</li>

Thankfully David Beazley finds the GIL &#8216;fun&#8217; and has posted some slides about it. <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/talks/EmbraceGIL/EmbracingGIL.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dabeaz/in-search-of-the-perfect-global-interpreter-lock">here</a>. Such geeky fun.</li>
<li>Feature Switching is an important concept to get your development team wrapped around if doing automation; <a href="http://www.paulstack.co.uk/blog/post/feature-switching-a-better-way-to-collaborate.aspx">Feature switching: a better way to collaborate</a> even has a common project feature-switch-inated linked to at the end.</li>
<li>Another important thing is hosting your own respository of build artifacts. <a href="http://www.build-doctor.com/2011/10/10/repository-thats-not-a-repository/">Repository? That’s not a repository</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twist4all.wordpress.com/2011/05/21/logging-selenium-2-events-in-twist/">Logging Selenium 2 Events in Twist</a> is a product centric spike report &#8212; but is a good read if you want to extend WebDriver</li>

<li>Automated configuration management with Puppet? <a href="https://github.com/cloudsmith/geppetto">Geppetto</a> seems to be an important addition to that toolset.</li>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-8-released/"><h2>Selenium 2.8 Released</h2></a>
            <p>In keeping with our (roughly) weekly releases, Selenium 2.8 was <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">released today</a> (and on Maven too), <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/CHANGELOG">with a *huge* list of bug-fixes</a>!  As well as improved stability, if you&#8217;re using the Java API, this release adds the ability to upload files to a RemoteWebDriver server (see <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/remote/RemoteWebDriver.html#setFileDetector(org.openqa.selenium.remote.FileDetector)">RemoteWebDriver.setFileDetector</a>).</p>
<p>Particular thanks have to go out to our two newest committers, Alexei Barancev and Ajay Kemparaj, for the copious bug-fixes they&#8217;ve contributed!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re already hard at work getting 2.9 ready for next week with even more more bug-fixes &#8211; watch this space!</p>

Of course, Watir can use WebDriver so they didn&#8217;t <i>have</i> to port their scripts to a different API (I sure hope they have the API well abstracted away from their scripts). And of course the title of the post implies that Facebook thinks that Watir/Selenium scripts are &#8216;Unit&#8217; tests which is suspect at best&#8230;</li>

<ul>
<li>It all began with <a href="http://angryweasel.com/blog/?p=325">Test Design for Automation</a> which lead to <a href="http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/automated-test-design-riffingripping.html">Automated Test Design (riffing/ripping off Alan Page)</a></li>
<li>And then through some weird Jedi mind control there was <a href="http://angryweasel.com/blog/?p=332">Design for <em>GUI</em> Automation</a> which in turn led to <a href="http://chrismcmahonsblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/more-ui-test-design-once-more-from-alan.html">more UI test design (once more from Alan Page)</a></li>
<li>And heck, why have two articles from the same author when you can have three?! <a href="http://angryweasel.com/blog/?p=342">It’s (probably) a Design Problem</a> &#8212; though I don&#8217;t think Chris has riffed off this one yet&#8230;</li>

<li>Who knew a collection of scrapebookers is called a &#8216;crop&#8217;? Also, a &#8216;scrapbooking consultant&#8217;? &#8212; automation is hard, let&#8217;s go scrapbooking! Anyways, <a href="http://blog.aclairefication.com/2011/09/taking-on-water/">Taking on Water</a> is dead on in terms of which things to prioritize when automating.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.kaner.com/pdfs/autosqa.pdf">Improving the Maintainability of Automated Test Suites</a> by Cem Kaner is an older paper, but the Strategies for Success on page 3 are important. Especially 1, 2 and 5.</li>

            <p><p>This instalment of catch-up week is brought to you by the letters C and I.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/pre-scm-buildstep">pre-scm-buildstep</a> plugin for jenkins adds a useful step into the job workflow.</li>
<li>Understanding your tools is important. Here is an explanation of Jenkings <a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/08/jenkins-internal-action-and-its.html">Action and its subtypes</a></li>
<li>You think <i>your</i> CI setup is impressive? Check out <a href="https://builds.apache.org/">the Apache Foundation&#8217;s Jenkins server</a></li>
<li>The easiest way to get CI going is with the ubiquitious but completely unoffically Ant JUnit XML format. <a href="http://www.stevetrefethen.com/blog/Publishing-Python-unit-test-results-in-Jenkins.aspx">Publishing Python unit test results in Jenkins</a> discusses a python package a bit for it.</li>
<li>To me, using a headless browser like HTMLUnit makes very little sense. Now, a headful browser on a headless machine &#8212; that makes sense. <a href="http://iafonov.github.com/blog/setup-jenkins-to-run-headless-selenium.html">Setting up Jenkins CI to run selenium tests and record video in three easy steps</a> explains how to do this in Ruby.</li>
<li><a href="http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/selenium-setup/">Travis CI &#8211; Selenium setup</a> shows the similar thing minus the recording of a video for the Travis CI environment.</li>
<li>So far it seems that one should just subscribe to the Multunus blog and be done with it. Or at least <a href="http://www.multunus.com/blog/all/continuous-delivery/">the continuous delivery category</a>.</li>
<li>Think your web app deployment is &#8216;hard&#8217;? <a href="http://blog.octo.com/en/continuous-delivery-how-do-we-deliver-in-3-clicks-to-7000-machines/">Continuous Delivery: How do we deliver in 3 clicks to 7000 machines?</a> discusses a .NET client application. Now go count your blessings and get that remote svn export scripted.</li>
<li><a href="http://theagileadmin.com/2011/09/12/wont-somebody-please-think-of-the-systems/">Won’t somebody please think of the systems?</a> looks at CI with a bit of an ITIL lens</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.stevemoyer.net/2011/09/distributed-check-in-tokens-pass-puppy.html">Distributed Check-in Tokens: Pass-The-Puppy</a> presents a quick technical solution for not breaking the build through tokens.

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-6-released/"><h2>Selenium 2.6 Released</h2></a>
            <p>If you&#8217;ve been watching this blog carefully you&#8217;ll have noticed that the last release announcement we made was for 2.3, so it may come as a surprise that we&#8217;re announcing that <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">2.6 has been released</a> (even on Maven!). Don&#8217;t worry: 2.4 and 2.5 were released on time and without muss or fuss. 2.6, on the other hand has been almost three weeks brewing.</p>
<p>Selenium 2.6 introduces a raft of improvements and stability fixes. Kristian Rosenvold has been working wonders on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2">Grid 2.0</a>, addressing many reported issues and cleaning up the implementation. In the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=14">finest tradition of the project</a>, I now <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2475">owe him a dinner</a> for his hard work. Thank you, Kristian!</p>
<p>For those of you not using Grid, as well as the normal suite of bug fixes, Selenium 2.6 now supports all versions of Firefox from 3.0 up to 7. For those of you using Java, there is an <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/ExpectedConditions.html">ExpectedConditions</a> class that supplies many useful criteria when using the <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/Wait.html">Wait</a> and <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/support/ui/WebDriverWait.html">WebDriverWait</a> classes. The packaged version of the <a href="http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/operadriver/">OperaDriver</a> has also been bumped to 0.7.2, which works hand-in-hand with Opera 11.5 and above.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also spent a considerable amount of time and effort working out the kinks in the <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/package-frame.html">Advanced User Interactions API</a>. We&#8217;d love to hear how you&#8217;re using it, and what the gaps are that you can see. For more details about what&#8217;s changed, have a look at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/java/CHANGELOG">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>The release frequency has dropped recently, but we&#8217;re planning to head back to weekly releases from here on in. 2.7 is just around the corner!</p>

            <p>Rather than surprising the general community in ways that we have become somewhat known for, I figured I would try something new. Actually asking about usage of things before changing them in fundamental ways.</p>
<p>To this end, I have created a quick(!) <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DZC89TF">survey</a> about changes that are under consideration regarding UI-Maps and how Se-IDE is opened.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DZC89TF">survey</a> is only two questions, so I&#8217;m hoping for a large response. I&#8217;ll post the results next Monday (August 8, 2011).</p>
<p>One more time for good luck, the survey is over <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DZC89TF">here</a>.</p>

            <p><p>Continuing our new tradition of weekly releases, we&#8217;re very pleased to announce the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">release of Selenium 2.3</a>. The release notes for this version are pretty slim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better detection of clickable areas in Firefox.</li>
<li>Merge of Google-contributed code into the underlying javascript libraries used by the drivers.</li>
</ul>
<div>We&#8217;ve also fixed bugs, one of which was being a nuisance for users of IBM&#8217;s JRE. The complete changelog can be found in the zipped downloads or in <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/java/CHANGELOG">our source tree</a>.</div>
<div>If you&#8217;re a Chrome user, then it&#8217;s a great idea to head over to the<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/downloads/list"> Chromium project&#8217;s download page</a> to pick up the executable used by the ChromeDriver. It&#8217;s recently been updated, and now includes support for handling alerts and prompts! Thanks, Google!</div></p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-2-released/"><h2>Selenium 2.2 Released</h2></a>
            <p>The feedback from the last release was heard loud and clear: little and often it is!</p>
<p>We&#8217;re proud to announce the release of <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">Selenium 2.2</a>. What&#8217;s new this time? For many users, this is simply a bug fix release as there are no new major features. One thing you might appreciate is <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/IllegalLocatorException.html">better exceptions</a> being thrown when xpath searches return something other than a web element when using the WebDriver APIs, and we&#8217;re continuing to tweak the emulation of user events.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a .Net user, there is now an official<a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Selenium.WebDriver"> NuGet package</a>, and if you&#8217;re a maven user then rest assured the release is heading to the central repo as quickly as we can manage.</p>

            <p><p>Last week we released Se-IDE 1.1.0 which now features WebDriver formats and Se 2.1.0 was released about an hour ago. Simon will post something shortly-ish on what&#8217;s changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I haven&#8217;t messed around with HTML5 goodies yes, but <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fake-html5/">fake-html5</a> seems like it could be interesting.</li>
<li>The Yii framework <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/webdriver-test/">has grown WebDriver support</a>. Now if only there were not two competing PHP implementations for them to have to choose from&#8230;</li>
<li>If you are using Python&#8217;s native packaging system to share your framework, then <a href="http://blog.codekills.net/2011/07/15/lies,-more-lies-and-python-packaging-documentation-on--package_data-">Lies, More Lies and Python Packaging Documentation on <code>package_data</code></a> could spare you some headache</li>

<li>Creating users for the duration of a run is a problem a lot of systems have. But not with Facebook which has a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/test_users/">Test Users</a> API it seems. Don&#8217;t forget that you can use this idea internally in your apps too.</li>
<li>With the release of Selenium 2, the project is focuses not on being a browser <i>test</i> platform, but a browser <i>automation</i> one. The difference can be subtle but one area of big difference is in terms of network information details. Selenium RC has support for it, but Selenium WebDriver does not. And of course the latter is the future of the project. 99% of the time, you really <i>don&#8217;t</i> need the network information, but in that other 1% the official response to the problem is use something like <a href="https://github.com/lightbody/browsermob-proxy">the BrowserMob Proxy</a> which also had <a href="https://github.com/jarib/browsermob-proxy-rb">Ruby bindings</a> released this week.</li>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-1-released/"><h2>Selenium 2.1 Released</h2></a>
            <p>Now that Selenium 2 has <a href="http://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/selenium-2-0/">been released</a>, one of the goals of the project is to provide regular updates to our users and the community. The aim is for these updates to be small and manageable, incrementally addressing issues and problems raised by you. Selenium 2.1, which is <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">launched today</a>, marks the first of these regular, small releases.</p>
<p><a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">Selenium 2.1</a> is largely focused on improving Grid with a host of minor improvements including better tracking of &#8220;orphaned&#8221; browser instances. There are also some bug fixes in the Firefox and IE WebDrivers, particularly when dealing with elements that are <em>just</em> off screen, and in making the Selenium RC emulation in the Java bindings more robust when confronted with pages that haven&#8217;t started loading.</p>
<p>As you can see, this is a &#8220;bite size&#8221; release, but we&#8217;d love to know: would you prefer these small, swift releases or larger ones? Please answer in the comments, or on the <a href="groups.google.com/group/selenium-users">mailing list</a>!</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0/"><h2>Selenium 2.0: Out Now!</h2></a>
            <p>We are very, very pleased to announce the<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/"> release of Selenium 2.0</a>. If you&#8217;ve been waiting for a stable release since 1.0.3, now&#8217;s the chance to update. And if you do, what will you find?</p>
<p>For users of Selenium 1, this is a drop-in replacement. You&#8217;ll find support for modern browsers such as <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox 5</a> and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/internet-explorer/products/ie/home">IE 9</a>, as well as a wealth of bug fixes and stability improvements.  That&#8217;s one reason to update, but what other reasons are there?</p>
<p>The big feature of this release &#8212; and the reason for the new version number &#8212; are the new WebDriver APIs for <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/selenium">Python</a>, <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list">Java and C#</a>. These have been in development for over four years, and are already widely used, trusted and depended on. The WebDriver APIs have been written by developers familiar with each language, so they feel like they belong there. We&#8217;re very proud of them, and hope you enjoy using them.</p>
<p>Support for WebDriver is also baked into <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>, and we&#8217;re working closely with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> to ensure that their browsers also support it. Looking to the future, WebDriver also works on both Android and iPhone, allowing you to test your sites on the next wave of the Web.</p>
<p>As well as support by the browser vendors, WebDriver also provides excellent emulation of user inputs using something we call &#8220;native events&#8221;. Normal browser automation frameworks, including older versions of Selenium, simulate user interactions via the Javascript engine of the browser. This approach is error prone as each browser has its own quirks. &#8220;Native events&#8221; are fired at the OS level instead, avoiding a large amount of browser-specific complexity.</p>
<p>Advanced Selenium users will be pleased to hear that the standalone selenium server also includes support for distributed testing via <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2">Selenium Grid</a>. This new Grid implementation supports testing using both the original Selenium API and WebDriver, and has been developed as a collaboration between the current Grid maintainer and an engineer from eBay.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re working hard to ensure that Selenium IDE also supports all these new features and APIs. IDE version 1.1.0 should be released next week, with support for exporting to the four main languages supported by WebDriver. Please keep an eye on this blog for announcements! There will also be follow up posts, exploring and explaining each of the new features, and providing you with more information.</p>
<p>Of course, Selenium 2.0 is a major milestone, but we&#8217;re not done yet. This release marks the point where we expect our APIs to change very little from now on and where we believe it&#8217;s a solid release. Like all software, it has niggles and bugs, and we&#8217;ll be focusing on addressing these as your feedback comes in.</p>
<p>As a personal note, I&#8217;d like to say thank you to each of the many people that have worked so hard to make this the best Selenium version yet. Not only the developers but also the team working on making our <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/">documentation</a> clear and easy to read, everyone who&#8217;s taken the time to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list">report bugs</a>, and also to you; our <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/webdriver">users</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users">community</a>. The project is great fun to work on, and you&#8217;re the reason for that. Thank you!</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/new-chromedriver/"><h2>New ChromeDriver</h2></a>
            <p>The ChromeDriver is composed of two major pieces. There are the client APIs, which you use in your tests, and there&#8217;s a server part, which the client APIs know how to start and run and which takes the form of an executable called &#8220;chromedriver&#8221;. The server piece is maintained by the Chromium team, and they&#8217;ve just released a new version, with support for Chrome 14 and with bug fixes. If you&#8217;re using Selenium 2.0rc3 and you&#8217;re also using the ChromeDriver, head over to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/downloads/list">Chromium project&#8217;s download page</a> for the latest and greatest!</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc3-the-next-ones-the-big-one-release/"><h2>Selenium 2.0rc3: The “Next One’s The Big One” Release</h2></a>
            <p>When we pushed the 2.0rc1 live, we really hoped that the next release would be 2.0 final. We very quickly got some feedback that encouraged us to push a 2.0rc2. Now, after just under three weeks, we&#8217;re launching a third and final release candidate. You can download it from the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">Selenium HQ</a> site or directly from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list">Google Code.</a></p>
<p>We think we&#8217;ve addressed many of the common issues, added some polish and added a host of bug fixes and minor changes, and we hope to hear your feedback! The following headline changes have been made in Selenium 2rc3:</p>
<ul>
<li>The deprecated RenderedWebElement interface has now been removed. Most of the functionality has been moved to either <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html">WebElement</a> or to the <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/Actions.html">Actions</a> class.</li>
<li>The deprecated WebElement.getValue() method has been removed. Use <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#getAttribute(java.lang.String)">WebElement.getAttribute(&#8220;value&#8221;)</a> instead.</li>
<li>After some debate in the team, &#8220;<a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#setSelected()">WebElement.setSelected</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#toggle()">WebElement.toggle</a>&#8221; have been deprecated. They will be removed in the final release.</li>
<li>Thanks to the hard work of Mozilla engineers, we now offer Firefox 5 support.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/operadriver/">Opera driver</a>, developed by the lovely chaps at Opera Software, is bundled with this release.</li>
<li>Improvements in the way that mouse interactions are simulated, particularly when elements are outside the visible area of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with almost all releases, there are still some issues left to resolve, but we&#8217;re working hard to make Selenium 2.0 as good as it can be.</p>

<ul>
<li>Selenium IDE 1.0.11 was released &#8212; with Firefox 4 support. Finally.

            <p>You win some and you lose some. We&#8217;d been really pleased to get Selenium 2.0rc1 out, so we were pretty disappointed to hear that some of you were running into problems with the Java version of the IE driver not launching IE sometimes. That&#8217;s definitely not good, so we fixed the problems and have<a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list"> released Selenium 2.0rc2</a>. It&#8217;s the same as rc1, but with fewer problems 🙂</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still very keen to hear your feedback! Let us know what you think!</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0rc1-the-grid-release/"><h2>Selenium 2.0rc1: The Grid Release</h2></a>
            <p>We&#8217;re very happy to announce the first Release Candidate for Selenium 2, available for Java, C#, Ruby and Python. The API has been stabilised and the functionality needed for the final 2.0 release is mostly in. We’re going to be working hard to get there as soon as possible, but now’s the perfect time to test the waters and provide us with any feedback you may have! <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list">Grab the downloads from the site</a>!</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2">Grid 2</a>: A major feature of this release is Grid 2, an implementation of the Selenium Grid that supports WebDriver&#8217;s wire protocol, allowing tests using Selenium WebDriver to be distributed through it. There are some <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2">docs to help you get started</a> on the wiki.</li>
<li>New <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver">ChromeDriver</a>: Following a complete rewrite of the ChromeDriver, Selenium 2 is now supported natively by the Chrome browser itself. In order to use this, you must download the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list">chromedriver executable</a> from the Selenium project site.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/operadriver/">OperaDriver</a> support: We&#8217;ve bundled the most excellent OperaDriver into the release to make it easy to get started testing with <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">Opera</a>.</li>
<li>Support for native events in Firefox 4.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/AdvancedUserInteractions">Advanced User Interactions</a>: An API that allows you to model complex user interactions, such as clicking on an element, holding the shift key, clicking on three more, and then dragging the four elements to a final destination. The entry point to this API is the <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/interactions/Actions.html">Actions</a> class.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also deleted all methods that were deprecated in 2.0b3 and have marked a number of methods and classes (notably <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/RenderedWebElement.html">RenderedWebElement</a> and <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#getValue()">WebElement.getValue</a>) deprecated. These will be deleted in the next release.</p>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Native events on Linux may not work properly on tests that include alerts and prompts.</li>
<li>Mouse actions using the Advanced User Interactions API may not work properly for elements that have to be scrolled into view.</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan on making our releases more frequent in the run up to 2.0final and polish off the bugs and issues. Stay tuned! This is going to be fun 🙂</p>

<li>CSS vs. XPath is one of the great talking points in the Se community.

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0b3-the-next-gen-browser-release/"><h2>Selenium 2.0b3: The Next Gen Browser Release</h2></a>
            <p>It&#8217;s been about 5 weeks since the release of beta 2, so we&#8217;re very pleased to announce that Selenium 2.0b3 has just been released simultaneously for Java, .Net, Ruby and Python. You can <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/download/">download it from Selenium HQ</a> or from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list">Google Code site</a>. This release focused on providing excellent support for the next generation of browsers, particularly IE 9 and Firefox 4, and we think you&#8217;ll like what you&#8217;ll find.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restructured documentation at<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/"> Selenium HQ</a></li>
<li>An improved user interaction API
<ul>
<li>Including experimental IME support on Windows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alerts and prompts handling for IE.</li>
<li>Marked the following APIs as obsolete in .Net:
<ul>
<li>IRenderedWebElement.Hover()</li>
<li>IOptions.Speed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even more improvements to the Java webdriver-backed selenium
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ll document the migration path before 2.0b4 is out!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A significantly faster <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/android-server-2.0b3.apk">Android Driver</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As well as these changes, there&#8217;s also the regular clutch of bug fixes and tweaks. For the number crunchers, there were a total of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/list?num=331&amp;start=11749">331 changes</a> that landed in the 5 weeks since the last release, with the 5 most active contributors working on each of the different languages supported by Selenium.</p>
<p>In addition to the enormous thanks that go to the developers, I&#8217;d like to add a big thank you to the Mozilla engineers who chipped in on the IRC channel at the last minute to help us work through some issues with Core. We&#8217;d not have been able to get this release out when we did without their help. Thank you Mozilla!</p>
<p>The next release will be focused on stabilization work, reducing our bug count and adding support for Grid 2.0.</p>

            <p><p>What started out as the week of Capybara rounded itself out fairly nicely</p>
<li>I&#8217;m not a fan of using 3rd party abstraction layers (1st party are full win though) but Capybara has a large marketshare so <a href="http://opinionated-programmer.com/2011/02/capybara-and-selenium-with-rspec-and-rails-3">Capybara (and Selenium) with RSpec &amp; Rails 3: quick tutorial</a> is likely going to be of interest to people.</li>
<li>And while on the subject of Capybara, here is a post on <a href="http://testobsessed.com/2011/03/01/checking-invisible-elements/">Checking Invisible Elements</a> in it.</li>

<li><a href="http://devlicio.us/blogs/krzysztof_kozmic/archive/2011/02/28/unit-tests-are-overrated.aspx">Unit tests are overrated</a> is a nice reminder to change <i>all</i> the tests in a system for a change &#8212; not just the unit ones. (C&#8217;mon, how many of us haven&#8217;t been burned and/or responsible for this.)</li>

<p><i>Successful test automation uses good tests that provide clear test results. A pass or no-pass result must be confident and trustworthy. By focusing on what the system should do rather than how it does it, this can be achieved easily and without breaking existing test cases whenever the logic of the system is changed.</i></li>

Would be even better using Page Objects that were controlled externally so you don&#8217;t have to modify working scripts to enable/disable timings. But that&#8217;s an exercise for the reader to do. (Oh, and if their marketing firm wasn&#8217;t tweeting about it every day, that would be keen too.)</li>

            <p><p>Is this week&#8217;s post the  Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything Selenium?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/selenium-2---get-number-of-rows-in-a-table/52">Selenium 2 &#8211; Get Number of Rows in a Table</a> illustrates what is advertised, though it feels like there has to be a shorter way to do this along the lines of getXpathCount() or getCssCount()</li>
<li><a href="http://leonardinius.blogspot.com/2011/02/atlassian-plugin-sdk-how-to-provide.html">Atlassian Plugin SDK &#8211; how to provide optional selenium tests</a> explains how to wire up Se with the Atlassian toolkit and has a couple task specific tips as well.</li>
<li><a href="http://jwbito.ballardview.com/2011/02/automated-test-for-facebook-canvas-apps.html">Automated Test for Facebook Canvas Apps – Front-end automation with Selenium</a> is very buzzword compliant: Selenium-WebDriver, Facebook, Canvas. All it needs is to run on a mobile device.</li>
<li>Sauce Labs have released <a href="http://code.google.com/p/se-builder/">Se-Builder</a> which is their interpretation of what a next generation record/playback tool might look like.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m sure I had to know about this already, but <a href="http://www.wakaleo.com/books/continuous-integration-with-hudson-the-book">Jenkins: The Definitive Guide</a> is an open-source book on everyone&#8217;s favourite politically embroiled CI server. Speaking of politics, here is an <a href="http://daniel.gredler.net/2011/02/15/hudson-and-jenkins-two-weeks-later/">interesting graph</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2011/02/15/measure-anything-measure-everything/">Measure Anything, Measure Everything</a> seems pretty cool. Suspect you could do something in your scripts to ping the counter so you could get visualizations of your runs.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/energizedwork/selenium-ide-nle">Se-IDE Natural Language Extension</a> is <i>very</i> cool. Now, if only they had gone the extra step to make it a <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/plugins.html">plugin</a></li>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-0b2-released/"><h2>Selenium 2.0b2 Released</h2></a>
            <p>We&#8217;ve just released Selenium 2.0b2. If you&#8217;re the impatient sort who loves to have the latest and greatest, head over to the<a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list"> download site</a> and get it while it&#8217;s hot. If you&#8217;re a Python user, then all you need to do is a simple &#8220;pip install -U selenium&#8221;. Ruby users can, as ever, simply run &#8220;gem install selenium-webdriver&#8221;. Maven users need to wait just a little bit longer: we&#8217;re going to be checking the release in ASAP.</p>
<p>Between beta 1 and beta 2, we held a week-long Bug Bash, during which we closed a significant number of bugs. From a user&#8217;s perspective, other highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A more stable, capable iPhone driver.</li>
<li>Updated <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=selenium-server-2.0b2.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=">Android driver</a>.</li>
<li>Improved python bindings for Selenium WebDriver. The namespace is now &#8220;selenium.webdriver&#8221;</li>
<li>Added &#8220;<a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/com/thoughtworks/selenium/Selenium.html#getCssCount(java.lang.String)">Selenium.getCssCount</a>&#8221; to mirror &#8220;Selenium.getXpathCount&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebElement.html#getText()">WebElement.getText()</a>&#8221; performs more consistently across different browsers.</li>
<li>Mono users can use the .Net bindings</li>
<li>Continued to improve the <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/WebDriverBackedSelenium.html">WebDriverBackedSelenium</a>. If you&#8217;re looking to migrate from Selenium 1 to Selenium 2, and want to take your time, this is a useful stepping stone.</li>
<li>Reworked the Advanced User Interactions APIs. The big change is that the WebDriver APIs no longer rely on classes from the AWT.</li>
<li>.Net users now have more support classes, to make writing tests less tiresome.</li>
<li>The remote webdriver makes better use of sockets, which improves stability and scalability on Windows.</li>
<li>Started to add support for driving multiple IE instances. This is considered experimental, but we&#8217;d love to hear it&#8217;s working for you!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the guts of Selenium 2 and how it worked, then you might find these interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued reworking the IE and iPhone drivers to use the Automation Atoms.</li>
<li>Reworked the structure of the source tree to be more language focused.</li>
<li>We have the skeleton of a webdriver-backed selenium for Python.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, this is a big release. Beta 3 should be out a lot more quickly, and will be focusing on improving support for IE 9 and Firefox 4. Over the course of the 2.0b3 development, we shall also be removing as many deprecated methods as possible, so be sure to remove deprecation warnings from your builds when using 2.0b2!</p>

            <p><p>There isn&#8217;t an official announcement anywhere (yet) but Selenium 2.0b2 was released a couple hours ago. Time to upgrade all your servers. Beta 3 is going to focus on IE9 and FF4 support.</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/operadriver_released/"><h2>OperaDriver Released</h2></a>
            <p>I think the word that I&#8217;m looking for is &#8220;wow&#8221;. Perhaps &#8220;Wow!&#8221; would express the concept a little more clearly. Perhaps &#8220;WOW!&#8221; would be even clearer.  Yes, definitely. &#8220;WOW!&#8221; is a good way of describing <a href="http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2011/02/09/">this</a>.</p>
<p>Before Christmas, Opera Software announced a <a href="http://my.opera.com/core/blog/operawatir-pre-release">pre-release of OperaWatir</a>, an implementation of the Watir 2 API. What you may not know is that Watir 2 rests on the same WebDriver core as Selenium 2. Today, Opera made the source of the <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver">OperaDriver</a> available on github: <a href="https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver">https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver</a></p>
<p>This is “WOW!” It’s the first time a browser manufacturer has released their own implementation of the WebDriver APIs, and it shows how much Opera values test automation. Selenium 2 users now have an easy way to test that their sites work with <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/">Opera</a>.</p>
<p>What are you waiting for? Go! Download! Test!</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-joins-the-software-freedom-conservancy/"><h2>Selenium Joins the Software Freedom Conservancy</h2></a>
            <p>It doesn&#8217;t seem that long ago that we announced on the mailing list that the Selenium project planned to join the <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>. I&#8217;m very pleased to announce that as of Friday, 21st January, our application was approved. We&#8217;re now under the aegis of the SFC.</p>
<p>From most people&#8217;s perspective, this won&#8217;t make much difference: you&#8217;ll still be able to view the documentation and download the latest versions of Selenium from <a href="http://seleniumhq.org">Selenium HQ</a>. Development will continue to use <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/">Google Code&#8217;s</a> code hosting and issue tracking. We are now, however, part of a formal non-profit organization, which means that a number of issues, such as how to handle revenues from adverts on our sites, become clearer and more transparent.</p>
<p>There are more details about what this means in the <a title="Selenium Joins the Software Freedom Conservancy" href="http://sfconservancy.org/news/2011/feb/02/selenium-joins/">SFC&#8217;s announcement</a> and their list of <a title="SFC Member Project Services" href="http://sfconservancy.org/members/services/">membership benefits</a>. The bottom line is that this is a major milestone in Selenium&#8217;s growth and ensures that as we continue to grow our user base and introduce new features and projects, we&#8217;ll have strong support and backing from a well-respected Open Source organization.</p>

            <p><p>Hey look! All caught up &#8212; only took a month&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>My opinions on Continuous Deployment are pretty widely known, but the IMVU folks certainly have a lot of neat tricks to &#8216;borrow&#8217;. Such as <a href="http://engineering.imvu.com/2011/01/19/buildbot-and-intermittent-tests/">Buildbot and Intermittent Tests</a></li>
<li>Dealing with an API that returns XML? Your scripts don&#8217;t care about the readibility, but it helps you as the human if it is formatted pretty. <a href="http://www.shell-tools.net/index.php?op=xml%5Fformat">xml formatter</a> is a glorious time save in that case.</li>
<li>Who would have predicted this&#8230; Perl stuff
<ul>
<li><a href="http://onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/">Modern Perl</a> is a free Creative Commons book on Perl (with a dead-tree version also available)</li>
<li>I had thought the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-WWW-Selenium/">Se-RC style bindings</a> had been abandoned, but heard <a href="http://twitter.com/davehodg/statuses/30312545696878592">second hand</a>, they are alive and well.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aivaturi/Selenium-Remote-Driver">Webdriver Remote Driver</a> is the start of work on a Se2 driver. Now to get the two projects working together.</li>
<li>And the reason for the Perl stuff is <a href="http://www.davehodgkinson.com/blog/2011/01/hudson-and-selenium/">Hudson and Selenium</a></li>
</ul>
<li>Since Se is using Sizzle now for locators, comes <a href="http://twitter.com/envatowebdev/statuses/30833435383701504">a tip</a> &#8211; <i>never do things like $(&#8216;form *&#8217;). This is crazy costly, because Sizzle works from right to left. Will grab all elems first.</i>. Not sure of the accuracy, but it makes sense.</li>
<li>Part of the debate when doing BDD and TDD is the overlap that [naturally] occurs; <a href="http://gojko.net/2011/01/28/duplication-between-bdd-and-unit-tests/">Duplication between BDD and Unit tests</a> addresses it, partly be reframing the question.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/webkitdriver/">webkitdriver</a> is a project that <i>aims to provide a WebDriver implementation for a light-weight in memory Web Browser</i></li>
<li>This week&#8217;s Selenium <i>killer</i> is <a href="http://ariya.blogspot.com/2011/01/phantomjs-minimalistic-headless-webkit.html">PhantomJS</a></li>
<li>Achievement parodies are always amusing; here is on for <a href="http://blog.whiletrue.com/2011/01/what-if-visual-studio-had-achievements/">Visual Studio</a> &#8212; what would the Selenium ones look like?</li>
<li>Koans are a trendy way to learn / practice a language. Here is a <a href="http://www.rubygeek.com/2011/01/22/koan-a-copia/">Koan-a-copia of them</a></li>
<li>Want onto the speaking circuit? The 2011 <a href="http://www.verifyati.com/index.php?option=com_jforms&amp;view=form&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=85">Verify/ATI Conference is asking for presentations</a>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/bug-bash-aftermath/"><h2>Bug Bash Aftermath</h2></a>
            <p>What a week! I&#8217;m almost (almost!) sorry that the Bug Bash is over. I&#8217;d like to say thank you to everyone involved in the Bug Bash, from those reporting issues, through those brave souls (Dharani, Anthony, Jari!) who went through the issue tracker, applied labels and made sure the issues were still fresh, all the way to those contributing fixes. And the top five bug fixers were?</p>
<ol>
<li>Jari Bakken (24 issues)</li>
<li>Simon Stewart (21 issues)</li>
<li>David Burns, aka: AutomatedTester (11 issues)</li>
<li>Jim Evans (10 issues)</li>
<li>Michael Tamm (6 issues)</li>
</ol>
<p>Some interesting nuggets of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>We closed 85 issues over the course of the week (that&#8217;s about 20% of all open Selenium issues)</li>
<li>There were 111 checkins last week alone</li>
<li>All of the major languages supported by Selenium 2 are represented here.</li>
<li>Jari Bakken needs to be bought a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chris_mcmahon/status/30372577704681473">steak as big as his head.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What does this mean? It means that the next release of Selenium is set to be very solid. We&#8217;re going to be spending another week or so making sure that everything is stable after the influx of changes, but you can expect 2.0b2 to be out &#8220;real soon now&#8221;</p>
<p>If you missed the Bug Bash but still want to contribute, it&#8217;s never too late. Feel free to drop by the IRC channel, or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/checkout">checkout the source</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list">find a bug</a> and start building!</p>

            <p><p>If you&#8217;re using Maven and the 2.0b1 release of Selenium, you may be running into some problems getting maven to pick up your tests. The underlying problem is that selenium contains support classes for both JUnit and TestNG. The solution is to add this to your pom.xml</p>

            <p><p>No. Really. I&#8217;m almost caught up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Want input in a non-english language but don&#8217;t want to convert your whole machine? <a href="http://inputking.com/">InputKing</a> might be able to help. And the fact it is in a browser means we can use it via Se.</li>
<li>HAR (HTTP Archive) is the format the cool kids are talking about, and now there is a <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/har">har gem</a> so you can make use of HAR files in you [Ruby] scripts.</li>
<li>Organizing scripts by tagging them is one bandwagon I got on last year to great success and while I don&#8217;t really live in the MS toolset, <a href="http://blog.simontimms.com/2011/01/test-categories-for-mstest.html">Test Categories for MSTest</a> is likely how how I would do it MSTest.</li>
<li>Selenium won an award! Again! See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY7aQbi2N0g">the video of Se winning &#8216;Best Open Source Functional Automated Test Tool&#8217;</a></li>
<li>How a script is named is a reflection of the person who wrote it, in <a href="http://stevesmithblog.com/blog/unit-test-naming-convention/">Unit Test Naming Convention</a> one such style is described and the reasoning explained. Just ignore the second half of the summary&#8217;s first sentence though.</li>
<li>Michael Larson is Working his way though <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/selenium-1-0-testing-tools-beginners-guide/book">Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools Beginners Guide</a> and documenting it in a series of blog posts he is calling <a href="http://mkl-testhead.blogspot.com/search/label/PRACTICUM">a practicum</a></li>
<li>Most people use Se to create a regression security blanked, but it there are some points to be discussed around <a href="http://investigatingsoftware.blogspot.com/2010/12/arrogance-of-regression-testing.html">the arrogance of regression testing</a></li>
<li>ATDD continues to mature and the results of two different pattern workshops <a href="http://www.managing-expectations.com/?p=1326">have now been posted</a>. If you are using Cucumber, RobotFramework, Fitnesse, etc. you might want to pay attention.</li>
<li>It always saddens me a bit when large threads pop up <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groupItem?view=&amp;srchtype=discussedNews&amp;gid=961927&amp;item=38882290&amp;type=member&amp;trk=EML_anet_ac_pst_ttle">on how to manage Se scripts</a>. It&#8217;s called version control kids. But I realize I&#8217;m an outlier on this.</li>
<li>I suspect a lot of Se folks have a similar tale to <a href="http://blog.abakas.com/2011/01/how-i-learned-to-code.html">How I Learned To Code</a></li>
</ul></p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/bug-bash/"><h2>Bug Bash: 24-30 January</h2></a>
            <p>When the <a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/">Selenium</a> and WebDriver projects merged, all those moons ago, we moved the infrastructure from something we hosted to Google Code. One reason for doing this was to make it easier for people to file bugs and feature requests. And it looks like people have been filing a <em>lot</em> of bugs and feature requests.</p>
<p>In the run up for the 2.0b2 release, we&#8217;ll be running a Bug Bash. This will run from the 24th January all the way to the end of the 30th January. The aim will be to focus on clearing our bug list as much as possible, so that beta2 will be the best release of Selenium yet. We will, of course, be recognizing people who squash the most bugs here on the blog, and we&#8217;re hunting out goodies to mail to the top bug bashers once the week is over.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to get involved, it&#8217;s easy:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/checkout">Check out</a> the source code</li>
<li>Find a bug you&#8217;d like to squash in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list">issue tracker</a></li>
<li>Fix it, attaching your patch to the issue</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s it. Easy! For help, and to ask questions of the core development team, please hop on to the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/support/">IRC channel</a> or email the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-developers">selenium-developers</a> group.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> The Bug Bash is now complete. All we have to do is count up the scores!</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/a-smattering-of-selenium-37b/"><h2>A Smattering of Selenium #37B</h2></a>
            <p>Let&#8217;s see how many announcements there were that didn&#8217;t get pushed out in a timely manner today shall we?</p>
<ul>
<li>Well, there is of course <a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/selenium-conf-is-coming-get-your-proposals-in/">Selenium Conf is coming</a> and you have until Friday to get your proposals in. Last I heard we had 37 which is impressive, but I think 50 should be doable.</li>
<li>On the meetup side of things there is
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Boston-Selenium-Users-Group/calendar/15997626/">Boston on January 25</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCSelenium/">NYC on January 26</a> (its not on the site yet, but I&#8217;m speaking, so trust me, it exists)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/seleniumlondon/calendar/16079171/">London on March 23</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://seleniumcamp.com/">SeleniumCamp</a> (<a href="http://translate.google.ca/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fseleniumcamp.com%2F&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=&amp;ie=UTF-8">English</a>) is coming to Kiev at the end of February. Suddenly we go from no &#8216;events&#8217; to lots.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m kinda surprised no one has done this one yet, but a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide-fitnesse-formatte/">FitNesse Formatter</a> plugin for Se-IDE is up on AMO</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.reallysimplethoughts.com/2010/12/28/the-selenium-expert-is-here/">Selenium Expert</a> is a plugin that <i>brings the wonderful world of inspections, tips, hints, fixes and refactoring to Selenese</i>. Samit is a plug-in making machine.</li>
<li>Gorilla Logic have <a href="http://blog.gorillalogic.com/2010/12/16/flexmonkium-4-1-4-released/">have released a new version of FlexMonkium</a> &#8212; with with fully synchronized versioning.</li>
<li><a href="http://seleniumspec.codeplex.com/">SeleniuMspec</a> is a cleverly named formatter for Mspec &#8212; though it isn&#8217;t distributed as an Se-IDE plugin (which would +1 its coolness)</li>
<li>And I quote, <i>Hewlett-Packard (HP) is announcing the discontinuance of HP WinRunner (WR) 7.5, 7.6, 8.0, 8.2, 9.2 (all editions) products.</i>. Is it wrong to say something like &#8216;Ding, dong, the witch is dead&#8217;?. Of course, we wouldn&#8217;t likely be here without WR, but who doesn&#8217;t love some friendly-ish ribbing? Here is he full <a href="http://support.openview.hp.com/encore/wr.jsp">notice</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.getkrypton.com/">Krypton</a> appears to be a cloud service for managing your Se scripts and has a &#8216;we need testers&#8217; box on their site if anyone is curious</li>
<li>And to illustrate that this space seems to have potential, or people think it does at any rate, <a href="http://www.testrunnr.com/">Test Runnr</a> also does cloud based script management with the added feature of running scripts against the <a href="http://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs</a> OnDemand cloud. So if you have a cloud based app that you script with Selenium stored in the cloud and executed in the cloud are you yourself a meta-cloud company?</li>
</ul>
<p>More tomorrow as we dig ourselves out of the hole.</p>

            <p>My scheme for catching up with links last week ran afoul of 900 geeks and their families melting the internets at <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash 2.0.1.1</a>. So let&#8217;s try it again this week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Capturing screenshots on script failure is a common trick and <a href="http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/capturing-web-page-screenshots-with-selenium-2/48">Capturing Web Page Screenshots with Selenium 2</a> is the first post I have seen that explains how to do with with Selenium WebDriver</li>
<li><a href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2011/01/selenium-xpath-marks-the-spot/">XPath marks the spot</a> uses a treasure map analogy around how to create good XPath &#8212; but at the same time propagates the &#8216;XPath is Inherently Evil&#8217; myth. I intentionally don&#8217;t link to myself nearly as much as I could, but think that my comment in the post is important.</li>
<li><a href="http://manbuildswebsite.com/2010/12/20/domain-test-values/">Unit Test Patterns: The Domain Test Values Class</a> describes a pattern to <i>provide values used in the testing of a domain in a way which improves understanding of test code by increasing readability and adding meaning to values.</i></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tlrobinson/leakhelper">leakhelper</a> is another of those tools that could be cool to integrate into your Se scripts. And if you do, don&#8217;t forget to document it and point it out to me&#8230;</li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/devtools/2010/12/missiles-failed-builds-bamboo-punisher.html">Missiles + Failed Builds = Bamboo Punisher</a> &#8212; actually, its a crazy high level of awesome</li>
<li><a href="http://www.michaeldkelly.com/archives/548">Software Testing Lightning Talks from IWST</a> includes some on automation at the end &#8212; but lots of good non-automation ones as well</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.codecentric.de/en/2010/12/testing-smartgwt-applications-with-selenium-and-robot-framework/">Testing SmartGWT Applications with Selenium and Robot Framework</a> is more Robot Framework goodness including <i>Add some meaningful ID&#8217;s to your code</i> &#8212; which is actually for SmartGWT but makes life <u>so</u> much easier</li>
<li>The author of Selenium Simplified compares his book to Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools in <a href="http://www.eviltester.com/index.php/2010/12/29/so-now-you-have-a-choice-of-selenium-testing-books-and-ebooks/">So now you have a choice of Selenium Testing books and ebooks</a> is a pretty fair and well-reasoned article. (Short version: buy both)</li>
<li>We can&#8217;t go a couple months without someone rediscovering the joys of sending text to the browser. This time it is <a href="http://blog.projectdirigible.com/?p=671">Functional testing with Selenium: issues with selenium.type, javascript events and keyPressNative</a> but has the additional twist of including a solution in code and not just whinging.</li>
<li>If you are a .NET developer, then <a href="http://www.bryancook.net/2011/01/selenium-toolkit-for-net-084-released.html">Selenium Toolkit for .NET 0.84 Released</a> might be of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p>And assuming I remembered to pay the internet bill, there will be more links tomorrow.</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-conf-is-coming-get-your-proposals-in/"><h2>Selenium Conf is coming… get your proposals in!</h2></a>
            <p>It has been mentioned at and hinted upon a couple times in the Smattering posts, but nothing has &#8216;officially&#8217; been mentioned here, so it is time we fix that.</p>
<p>The first <a href="http://seleniumconf.org">Selenium Conf</a> is a go!</p>
<p>The logistics are set and we&#8217;re starting to sort out the program. Here is what you need to know. Right. Now.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>When</em> &#8211; Monday, April 4 &#8211; Wednesday, April 6</li>
<li><em>Where</em> &#8211; <a href="http://www.marineclub.com/">Marines Memorial Club and Hotel</a></li>
<li><em>Why</em> &#8211; Its about darn time&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a community driven event, though our friends at <a href="http://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs</a> are doing a lot of the leg work on the facilities (and food!), as so we want the community to be at the front of the room and not just the usual folks that do the talking circuit. (Unless you really want me to talk all day &#8212; which I can as many can attest.) Because of this we have extended the talk submission to <strong>Friday, January 21, 2011 11:59 PM (Pacific Standard Time)</strong> to expand the both the number of proposals and the number of people proposing talks.</p>
<p><a href="https://spreadsheets1.google.com/a/saucelabs.com/viewform?formkey=dFlhX2J2cEd1UXBWaEdqeWRnX3F2MXc6MQ&amp;ndplr=1">Click here for the talk form</a></p>
<p>Have a vague notion that you would like to submit something but not sure what we are looking for? I offer these as guide posts to help your thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical over Theoretical &#8211; code will always trump handwaving around slides</li>
<li>Experience Reports &#8211; On our project, we did X and it did or did not work and here is what we learned as a result</li>
<li>No Sales Pitches! &#8211; We can get sales pitches at vendor driven conferences. If your talk&#8217;s proposal is accepted and then you deliver a thinly veiled sales pitch you should expect to have your mic turned off.</li>
<li>Varied Experience &#8211; If your talk can appeal to newbies and people on the core team, that is a win in my books</li>
</ul>
<p>So again, <a href="https://spreadsheets1.google.com/a/saucelabs.com/viewform?formkey=dFlhX2J2cEd1UXBWaEdqeWRnX3F2MXc6MQ&amp;ndplr=1">submit your talk</a> &#8211; or risk hearing me all day.</p>
<p>Oh, and mark on your calendars Tuesday, February 1 &#8212; because we bumped at the proposal date so too is the ticket release date.</p>

            <p>Second in a week-long series of catch-up posts. But before I get to the next batch of links, don&#8217;t forget to submit your proposals to speak at the first <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.com/">Selenium Conference</a>. I&#8217;m pretty sure we&#8217;re going to be trying to pick out the talks next week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we <em>please</em> adopt this as <a href="http://www.geneticanomaly.com/RPG-Motivational/slides/lawfulevil.html">the official poster</a> for Selenium? Please?</li>
<li>If you are a C# developer looking to get started with Selenium WebDriver, <a href="http://deanhume.com/Home/BlogPost/automated-testing-with-selenium-2-and-nunit/47">Automated Testing with Selenium 2 and NUnit</a> seems like a good place to start</li>
<li>Per the who &#8216;bringing order to the universe&#8217;, <a href="http://watirmelon.com/2010/12/14/watir-webdriver-a-detailed-introduction/">Watir-WebDriver: A detailed introduction</a> shows how to drive Watir using Selenium WebDriver</li>

<li>JUnit&#8217;s @Rule stuff is pretty serious magic, but really interesting. Here is <a href="http://cwd.dhemery.com/2010/12/junit-rules/">Using Rules to Influence JUnit Test Execution</a> and <a href="http://cwd.dhemery.com/2011/01/what-junit-rules-are-good-for/">What JUnit Rules are Good For</a></li>
<li>Some more information on how to use the Flash ExternalInterface is in <a href="http://blog.browsermob.com/2010/12/interaction-with-flash-using-selenium-and-javascript-–-part-2/">Interaction with Flash using Selenium and Javascript – Part 2</a></li>

<li>Use Lisp and want to use Selenium? Now you can with <a href="https://github.com/asdr/selenium-lisp-connector">selenium-lisp-connector</a></li>
<li>Looks like AutoIT3 might have some competition in the &#8216;drive native windows on Windows&#8217; space with RAutomation. Here is how to <a href="http://www.itreallymatters.net/post/2352350743/automating-windows-and-their-controls-with-ruby">Automating Windows and Their Controls With Ruby</a></li>
<li>In what could be the best project name since &#8216;Vlad the Deployer&#8217;, <a href="http://zombie.labnotes.org/">Zombie.js</a> is being touted as this week&#8217;s Selenium killer.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now I&#8217;m off to drive through lake effect snow to get to <a href="http://codemash.org">CodeMash</a> to stress out about my Selenium and Agile Testing workshops. Ah, the life of a consultant is certainly glamorous.</p>

            <a href="https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/a-smattering-of-selenium-36a/"><h2>A Smattering of Selenium #36A</h2></a>
            <p>I have drastically fallen behind on the link reporting, but not the collecting, so this week&#8217;s Smattering will be multi-part.<br />
<br />
The &#8216;big&#8217; news falls for this edition is two fold &#8211;</p>
<ol>
<li>We&#8217;re having a conference! <a href="http://www.seleniumconf.com/">Selenium Conference 2011</a> is April 4 &#8211; 6, 2011 in San Francisco. See the site for more information. (And I think our friends at Watir are going to be in the same space the day before.)</li>
<li>The Betas are here! The Beta&#8217;s are here! As Simon&#8217;s <a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/12/24/selenium-2-0-beta-1-release/">post</a> announced, Selenium 2.0b1 has been released to the [unsuspecting] masses. Everyone, including Se-RC users are encouraged to switch their server over to it &#8212; its backwards compatible with 1.x and has a tonne of important fixes (like the HEAD request on open, -htmlSuite works again, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>
And not to downplay things, but here are the usual assortment of things I think are of interest/value to those automating stuff [with Selenium].</p>
<ul>
<li>Checklists are a Good Thing&trade; when it comes to testing, so why not automation too? So here is a <a href="http://www.bryancook.net/2010/12/unit-test-review-checklist.html">Unit Test Review Checklist</a></li>
<li>ExtJS is one of those things that seems to come up more often than not on the se-users list which makes me think I&#8217;m lucky that none of my clients use it. <a href="http://amiworks.co.in/talk/testing-extjs-application-with-selenium-few-pointers/">Testing Extjs Application With Selenium : Few Pointers</a> seems like it would be useful in such an event though.</li>
<li>Those of us around the automation space for awhile have often heard about Google&#8217;s mythic &#8216;Small, Medium, Large&#8217; scheme for categorizing scripts &#8212; and now <a href="http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2010/12/test-sizes.html">they are documented</a>. Combining this idea with tagging of scripts and you&#8217;re laughing.</li>
<li>Looks like IBM is now starting to care about Selenium in developerWorks with <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-webautoselenium/index.html">Automated web testing with Selenium</a> which has an assortment of quick things to help people out. And it is IBM so it got lots of love from folks [bots?] on Twitter.</li>
<li>Personas is something from the UX community that I&#8217;ve started to think more about in terms of what gets automated and/or how the the scripts are organized. The <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/resources/persona-cheat-sheet/">Persona Cheat Sheet</a> will help you start down that road too.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.testingexperience.com/index.php">Testing Experience</a> magazine recently had an Open Source issue which had some interesting articles. Doesn&#8217;t appear to be anything groundbreaking, but my definition of that might be a bit warped.</li>
<li>Oooo! All of this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=1242F05D3EA83AB1">GTAC videos</a> in one place. Now you really can pretend you were in India for the week.</li>
<li><a href="http://trishkhoo.com/?p=272">Go faster! Linking data generation to hotkeys</a> is one of those posts that could be quite useful if you use automation to move quickly around a site so you can manually test it.</li>
<li>Selenium IDE 1.0.10 is a &#8216;stable&#8217; version (unlike 1.0.8 and 1.0.9 it seems) but did introduce one change to how element attributes are handled which I documented in <a href="https://seleniumhq.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/atoms-have-come-to-selenium-ide/">Atoms have come to Selenium IDE</a></li>
<li>Using Python&#8217;s unittest module? Consider upgrading to <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/articles/unittest2.shtml">unittest2</a></li>
</ul>
