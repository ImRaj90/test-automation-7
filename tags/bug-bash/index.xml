      <description>What a week! I&amp;#8217;m almost (almost!) sorry that the Bug Bash is over.

One reason for doing this was to make it easier for people to file bugs and feature requests. And it looks like people have been filing a lot of bugs and feature requests.
In the run up for the 2.0b2 release, we&amp;#8217;ll be running a Bug Bash. This will run from the 24th January all the way to the end of the 30th January.</description>
