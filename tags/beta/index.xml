      <description>Selenium 3 is coming! As I write this, we think that &amp;#8220;beta 4&amp;#8221; will be the last beta before the official 3.0 release.¬†I‚Äôm here to tell you about what‚Äôs changed, and what impact this will have on your testing.
TL;DR:  WebDriver users will just find bug fixes and a drop-in replacement for 2.x. Selenium Grid users will also find bug fixes and a simple update. The WebDriver APIs are now the only APIs actively supported by the Selenium project.</description>

      <description>At SeleniumConf in 2013, we announced that a new major version of Selenium would be released &amp;#8220;by Christmas&amp;#8221;. Fortunately, we never said which Christmas, as it has taken us a while to make all the changes we wanted to make! We&amp;#8217;re excited to announce the release of the first beta &amp;#8212; Selenium 3.0.0-beta1.
We&amp;#8217;d love you to try it out on your projects, and provide us with feedback on where the rough edges are before we ship the¬†3.</description>

      <description>When we pushed the 2.0rc1 live, we really hoped that the next release would be 2.0 final. We very quickly got some feedback that encouraged us to push a 2.0rc2. Now, after just under three weeks, we&amp;#8217;re launching a third and final release candidate. You can download it from the Selenium HQ site or directly from Google Code.
We think we&amp;#8217;ve addressed many of the common issues, added some polish and added a host of bug fixes and minor changes, and we hope to hear your feedback!</description>

      <title>Selenium 2.0rc2: The Better Working Release</title>

      <description>You win some and you lose some. We&amp;#8217;d been really pleased to get Selenium 2.0rc1 out, so we were pretty disappointed to hear that some of you were running into problems with the Java version of the IE driver not launching IE sometimes. That&amp;#8217;s definitely not good, so we fixed the problems and havereleased Selenium 2.0rc2. It&amp;#8217;s the same as rc1, but with fewer problems üôÇ
We&amp;#8217;re still very keen to hear your feedback!</description>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-2-0-beta-1-release/</guid>
      <description>We recently released the first of the betas for Selenium 2. It&amp;#8217;s available for Java, C# and Ruby. If you&amp;#8217;ve been holding off trying Selenium 2 because of the alpha label, then the biggest improvement you&amp;#8217;ll see is with the new WebDriver APIs, but there&amp;#8217;s a lot more!
 A promise of relatively stable APIs For Firefox only right now, an API for dealing with alerts, prompts and confirms. A brand new IE driver.</description>
