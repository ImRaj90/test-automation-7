      <title>Selenium IDE Is Dead, Long Live Selenium IDE! </title>
      <link>https://selenium.dev/blog/2018/long-live-selenium-ide/</link>

      <description>In August of 2017 Simon shared the bleak, hard news that as of Firefox 55 Selenium IDE would no longer work. Selenium IDE (or as we’ll refer to it from here on out – the Legacy IDE) was, and is, dead.
Since then quite a lot has happened with the IDE. We have a new version of it which we are referring to as… Selenium IDE!
It is currently in “alpha” and available for use in both Chrome and Firefox.</description>

      <title>Firefox 55 and Selenium IDE</title>
      <link>https://selenium.dev/blog/2017/firefox-55-and-selenium-ide/</link>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2017/firefox-55-and-selenium-ide/</guid>
      <description>The bad news: from Firefox 55 onwards, Selenium IDE will no longer work. 
The reasons for this are complex, but boil down to two main causes:
 Browsers are complicated pieces of software that are constantly evolving. Mozilla has been working hard to make Firefox faster and more stable, while still retaining the flexibility and ease of extension that we’ve come to know and love. As part of that process, Firefox is switching extensions from the original “XPI” format, to a newer, more widely adopted “Web Extension” mechanism.</description>

      <title>Selenium 3.0: Out Now!</title>

      <description>We are very pleased to announce the release of Selenium 3.0. If you’ve been waiting for a stable release since 2.53.1, now’s your chance to update. And if you do, here is what you’ll find:
As we’ve said before, for users of the WebDriver APIs this is a drop-in replacement. You’ll find that modern browsers, such as Chrome and Edge will continue to work just as before, and we’ve taken the opportunity to fix some bugs and improve stability.</description>

      <description>Selenium 3 is coming! As I write this, we think that &amp;#8220;beta 4&amp;#8221; will be the last beta before the official 3.0 release. I’m here to tell you about what’s changed, and what impact this will have on your testing.
TL;DR:  WebDriver users will just find bug fixes and a drop-in replacement for 2.x. Selenium Grid users will also find bug fixes and a simple update. The WebDriver APIs are now the only APIs actively supported by the Selenium project.</description>

      <description>At SeleniumConf in 2013, we announced that a new major version of Selenium would be released &amp;#8220;by Christmas&amp;#8221;. Fortunately, we never said which Christmas, as it has taken us a while to make all the changes we wanted to make! We&amp;#8217;re excited to announce the release of the first beta &amp;#8212; Selenium 3.0.0-beta1.
We&amp;#8217;d love you to try it out on your projects, and provide us with feedback on where the rough edges are before we ship the 3.</description>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2013/android-and-ios-support/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR: We&amp;#8217;re retiring Selenium&amp;#8217;s own AndroidDriver and iPhoneDriver in favour of any of Selendroid, iosdriver and Appium. If you&amp;#8217;re using one of Selenium&amp;#8217;s own mobile drivers, please evaluate one of these alternatives.
The longer version:
In 2007, Steve Jobs announced the iPhone and changed the mobile Web from a curiosity to something the mainstream wanted and used. Current trends suggest that mobile Web usage will surpass desktop usage in the not too distant future.</description>

      <description>Although the WebDriver APIs started life as just a mechanism for automating web browsers, over the past few years it has been extended to also work on mobile devices. Projects such as Appium, iosdriver, and Selendroid have all shown that this approach works, and works well. On the Web, if you start using Selenium WebDriver with one browser (Firefox, for example), it&amp;#8217;s easy to switch out the browser for another one (such as Internet Explorer or Chrome).</description>

      <description>Selenium 2 was released in July 2011. It’s now two years old, and what a couple of years it’s been! The WebDriver APIs, which were the major addition in Selenium 2, are now the basis for a W3C standard, and there are implementations written and supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera. There have been 34 releases, with official support for Java, C#, Python, Ruby and Javascript, and the community has stepped in to provide bindings for Perl, PHP and others.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a long time since we announced a new Selenium release on this blog, as we moved to a model of quicker releases, but we&amp;#8217;ve been working on 2.26 for far longer than normal &amp;#8212; it&amp;#8217;s out! Download it now! &amp;#8212; so I thought it best to let you know. We&amp;#8217;re aiming to head back to faster releases, so hopefully you won&amp;#8217;t see another blog post about the release for a while (though I&amp;#8217;m sure they&amp;#8217;ll appear in the &amp;#8220;Smatterings of Selenium&amp;#8221; posts)</description>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2012/announcing-selenium-2-22/</guid>
      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a while since the last Selenium release, but I&amp;#8217;m happy to announce that Selenium 2.22 is now available for download. This is a big release for us and features two major changes.
The first is that Selenium 2.22 is the first version that requires Java 6 in order to run. This has been the case for the Selenium Server for some time, but this is the first time the client code has required Java 6.</description>

      <title>A Note About the Cybervillains SSL Certificate</title>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2012/a-note-about-the-cybervillains-ssl-certificate/</guid>
      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re using Selenium RC to test websites hosted on a secure site (accessed using a URL starting with HTTPS), we strongly recommend that you upgrade to Selenium 2.19. This is because the Cybervillains certificate in previous versions will expire soon, and has been replaced in 2.19 with an updated one.
Our thanks to Patrick Lightbody, Ivan De Marino and Mark Watson and Neustar for taking providing the new certificate and the patch!</description>

      <description>You might be pleased to hear that Selenium 2.19 has been released (download it from here!). There&amp;#8217;s one big user facing changing that we&amp;#8217;d like to tell you about: the webdriver-backed selenium can now be used in supported languages.
By providing this capability, it&amp;#8217;s possible to migrate from RC to the WebDriver APIs without rewriting all your tests in one fell swoop (which must be a Good Thing, right?) An example of how to use it in Python would be:</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a while since we last blogged about a Selenium release. Since the release of 2.0, we&amp;#8217;ve been attempting to give you a fresh and shiny Selenium release every week (though, in reality, we&amp;#8217;re managing to get you one every 10 days on average). This allows you to pick the version that&amp;#8217;s most suitable for you and your teams, but provides a route for quick feedback on how we&amp;#8217;re doing.</description>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-9-released/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;#8217;re pleased to announce the release of Selenium 2.9. As well as improving the stability of Grid under high loads, we&amp;#8217;ve added an experimental (and temporary!) feature that allows the Firefox driver to use a different mechanism for determining when a page is loaded. This is designed to handle the case where the driver appears to hang, as it&amp;#8217;s waiting for all incoming requests to complete before continuing. How to enable this mode is listed in the changelog.</description>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-8-released/</guid>
      <description>In keeping with our (roughly) weekly releases, Selenium 2.8 was released today (and on Maven too), with a *huge* list of bug-fixes! As well as improved stability, if you&amp;#8217;re using the Java API, this release adds the ability to upload files to a RemoteWebDriver server (see RemoteWebDriver.setFileDetector).
Particular thanks have to go out to our two newest committers, Alexei Barancev and Ajay Kemparaj, for the copious bug-fixes they&amp;#8217;ve contributed!
We&amp;#8217;re already hard at work getting 2.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;ve been watching this blog carefully you&amp;#8217;ll have noticed that the last release announcement we made was for 2.3, so it may come as a surprise that we&amp;#8217;re announcing that 2.6 has been released (even on Maven!). Don&amp;#8217;t worry: 2.4 and 2.5 were released on time and without muss or fuss. 2.6, on the other hand has been almost three weeks brewing.
Selenium 2.6 introduces a raft of improvements and stability fixes.</description>

      <description>Continuing our new tradition of weekly releases, we&amp;#8217;re very pleased to announce the release of Selenium 2.3. The release notes for this version are pretty slim:
 Better detection of clickable areas in Firefox. Merge of Google-contributed code into the underlying javascript libraries used by the drivers.  We&amp;#8217;ve also fixed bugs, one of which was being a nuisance for users of IBM&amp;#8217;s JRE. The complete changelog can be found in the zipped downloads or in our source tree.</description>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2011/selenium-2-2-released/</guid>
      <description>The feedback from the last release was heard loud and clear: little and often it is!
We&amp;#8217;re proud to announce the release of Selenium 2.2. What&amp;#8217;s new this time? For many users, this is simply a bug fix release as there are no new major features. One thing you might appreciate is better exceptions being thrown when xpath searches return something other than a web element when using the WebDriver APIs, and we&amp;#8217;re continuing to tweak the emulation of user events.</description>

      <description>Now that Selenium 2 has been released, one of the goals of the project is to provide regular updates to our users and the community. The aim is for these updates to be small and manageable, incrementally addressing issues and problems raised by you. Selenium 2.1, which is launched today, marks the first of these regular, small releases.
Selenium 2.1 is largely focused on improving Grid with a host of minor improvements including better tracking of &amp;#8220;orphaned&amp;#8221; browser instances.</description>

For users of Selenium 1, this is a drop-in replacement. You&amp;#8217;ll find support for modern browsers such as Firefox 5 and IE 9, as well as a wealth of bug fixes and stability improvements. That&amp;#8217;s one reason to update, but what other reasons are there?</description>

And for those who did not download 1.0.11 (it was not pushed through the update system) you will want to read about the formatter change that landed. </description>

      <description>When we pushed the 2.0rc1 live, we really hoped that the next release would be 2.0 final. We very quickly got some feedback that encouraged us to push a 2.0rc2. Now, after just under three weeks, we&amp;#8217;re launching a third and final release candidate. You can download it from the Selenium HQ site or directly from Google Code.
We think we&amp;#8217;ve addressed many of the common issues, added some polish and added a host of bug fixes and minor changes, and we hope to hear your feedback!</description>

      <description>You win some and you lose some. We&amp;#8217;d been really pleased to get Selenium 2.0rc1 out, so we were pretty disappointed to hear that some of you were running into problems with the Java version of the IE driver not launching IE sometimes. That&amp;#8217;s definitely not good, so we fixed the problems and havereleased Selenium 2.0rc2. It&amp;#8217;s the same as rc1, but with fewer problems 🙂
We&amp;#8217;re still very keen to hear your feedback!</description>

This release focused on providing excellent support for the next generation of browsers, particularly IE 9 and Firefox 4, and we think you&amp;#8217;ll like what you&amp;#8217;ll find.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve just released Selenium 2.0b2. If you&amp;#8217;re the impatient sort who loves to have the latest and greatest, head over to thedownload site and get it while it&amp;#8217;s hot. If you&amp;#8217;re a Python user, then all you need to do is a simple &amp;#8220;pip install -U selenium&amp;#8221;. Ruby users can, as ever, simply run &amp;#8220;gem install selenium-webdriver&amp;#8221;. Maven users need to wait just a little bit longer: we&amp;#8217;re going to be checking the release in ASAP.</description>

      <description>It doesn&amp;#8217;t seem that long ago that we announced on the mailing list that the Selenium project planned to join the Software Freedom Conservancy. I&amp;#8217;m very pleased to announce that as of Friday, 21st January, our application was approved. We&amp;#8217;re now under the aegis of the SFC.
From most people&amp;#8217;s perspective, this won&amp;#8217;t make much difference: you&amp;#8217;ll still be able to view the documentation and download the latest versions of Selenium from Selenium HQ.</description>

      <title>2.0b1 and Maven</title>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re using Maven and the 2.0b1 release of Selenium, you may be running into some problems getting maven to pick up your tests. The underlying problem is that selenium contains support classes for both JUnit and TestNG. The solution is to add this to your pom.xml
&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.seleniumhq.selenium&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;selenium&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;2.0b1&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;exclusions&amp;gt; &amp;lt;exclusion&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.testng&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;testng&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/exclusion&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/exclusions&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;</description>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-2-0-beta-1-release/</guid>
      <description>We recently released the first of the betas for Selenium 2. It&amp;#8217;s available for Java, C# and Ruby. If you&amp;#8217;ve been holding off trying Selenium 2 because of the alpha label, then the biggest improvement you&amp;#8217;ll see is with the new WebDriver APIs, but there&amp;#8217;s a lot more!
 A promise of relatively stable APIs For Firefox only right now, an API for dealing with alerts, prompts and confirms. A brand new IE driver.</description>

      <description>We are extremely pleased to announce the release of Selenium 2.0a6! Head over to the downloads page to get it while it&amp;#8217;s hot, or wait just a little bit longer for it to appear in a maven repo near you. The .Net version will also be updated soon too, and the python and ruby libraries have been having smaller, more frequent releases all this time.
You&amp;#8217;ll be pleased to hear that the Selenium 1.</description>

      <title>How to use Selenium 2 with Maven</title>
      <link>https://selenium.dev/blog/2010/how-to-use-selenium-2-with-maven/</link>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2010/how-to-use-selenium-2-with-maven/</guid>
      <description>There are several ways to use Selenium 2:
 If you don&amp;#8217;t have Selenium 1.x legacy code, you might want to directly use on of the new WebDriver implemenations like ChromeDriver, HtmlUnitDriver, FirefoxDriver, or InternetExplorerDriver which provide a nice, small and easy to learn API. If you have Selenium 1.x legacy code, you can still use the well known DefaultSelenium class or the new WebDriverBackedSelenium, which extends DefaultSelenium but uses one of the WebDriver implementations internally.</description>

      <title>The Current Status of Selenium 1 and Selenium 2</title>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2010/the-current-status-of-selenium-1-and-selenium-2/</guid>
      <description>In the beginning there was Se1, and it was good. But it could have been better &amp;#8212; in ways that WebDriver was starting to be good at. Thus the brilliant idea was hatched to merge the two projects.
And then the confusion began. Let&amp;#8217;s see if I can start to address some of it via a ficticious conversation that consolidates the Se-user list and #selenium irc channel.
 There are a couple annoying bugs in Se-RC 1.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m pleased to announce the release of Selenium 2.0a5, available for immediate download. This release brings a host of changes under the hood, and represents the efforts of many contributors. Highlights include:
 Newinterfaces for dealing with HTML 5 elements. An API for &amp;#8220;implicit waits&amp;#8220;: quietly waiting until an element is present before continuing with a test. You can use them like this: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS) A revamped Firefox driver. More shared code between Selenium and WebDriver.</description>

      <title>Selenium-IDE – Looking back and looking forward</title>

      <description>Its been around six months and three releases since I took the reins of Selenium-IDE. The fundamental change in that time has been the adoption of a plugin model like the fine folks over that Firebug. (We&amp;#8217;re also self-hosting it which is big from a project internals perspective.)
Right now, you can add custom user-extensions and formatters, but in the very near future you will be able to add location strategies as well.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re pleased to announce the release of Selenium Grid 1.0.8. This release fixes multithreaded issues with the Selenium Grid hub that appeared randomly under heavy load. If you&amp;#8217;ve ever seen a log message about HttpClient being accessed by multiple threads, you definitely want to upgrade. Even if you haven&amp;#8217;t, this release is highly recommended for all.

      <title>Selenium IDE 1.0.7 – Now with Drag-and-Drop!</title>
      <link>https://selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-ide-1-0-7-released/</link>

      <guid>https://selenium.dev/blog/2010/selenium-ide-1-0-7-released/</guid>
      <description>So its a month later than planned, but Selenium IDE 1.0.7 is now available. The delay was due to some internal build changes and not code, but one of the code changes that is there more than makes up for the delay.
That&amp;#8217;s right, drag-and-drop has finally arrived to Se-IDE &amp;#8212; though credit lies with Jérémy Hérault for implementing it.
Oh, and if you are Swedish, there is now a localization for you.</description>

You can download it now or view the changelog. The list of changes are:
 Hub now instructs remote controls to shutdown a session if the hub is going to remove it due to being idle for too long Added ability to specify timeout period when waiting for remote controls to become available.</description>

      <description>As you likely know by now, after years of stewardship Philippe has stepped down as maintainer of Selenium Grid and has named me the new maintainer. In this post, I hope to address the most immediate questions about what this means for the future of Selenium Grid.
Background I realize many of you may not know who I am. I&amp;#8217;ve been using Selenium in some capacity for close to five years now.</description>

      <description>Hot off the heals of 1.0.2, we&amp;#8217;re releasing Selenium Remote Control 1.0.3. You can download it now.
There is no functional difference between this version and 1.0.2, other than it is packaged up a little nicer and we&amp;#8217;ve clarified the relationship between selenium-server and the client drivers. That is: we are not releasing new client drivers with future 1.x releases. The reason is that we locked down the API in version 1.</description>

      <description>Today we&amp;#8217;re happy to announce that Selenium Remote Control 1.0.2 has been released. While most of our efforts are on Selenium 2.0, we understand that there are millions of Selenium users that still need the 1.x line supported. That&amp;#8217;s why we&amp;#8217;ve said from the start that our goal is make 2.x 100% backwards compatible with 1.x. And that&amp;#8217;s why we&amp;#8217;re releasing a new version of Selenium RC today.
