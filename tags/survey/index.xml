      <description>Rather than surprising the general community in ways that we have become somewhat known for, I figured I would try something new. Actually asking about usage of things before changing them in fundamental ways.
To this end, I have created a quick(!) survey about changes that are under consideration regarding UI-Maps and how Se-IDE is opened.
The survey is only two questions, so I&amp;#8217;m hoping for a large response. I&amp;#8217;ll post the results next Monday (August 8, 2011).</description>
