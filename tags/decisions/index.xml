      <description>This short technical note is to announce that the Selenium project is now using git on Google Code in place of subversion.
The move has been a long time in the making, and it&amp;#8217;s largely thanks to the efforts of Kristian Rosenvold that we&amp;#8217;ve been able to do the migration and retain the project history. The project owes him a huge thank you! We&amp;#8217;re in the process of migrating the last bits and pieces (none of which are user facing), so there may be some last minute turbulence as we settle everything down.</description>

      <description>This is the second of my technical posts. Again, if you&amp;#8217;re interested in the internal workings of Selenium 2, then please skip straight to something else. If you&amp;#8217;re interested in how and why we made some of the technical decisions on the project, keep reading&amp;#8230;.
We left our intrepid heroes in a tight spot: they&amp;#8217;d decided to write a shared library of code, to be used by the various webdriver implementations and selenium core, but the requirements for doing this seemed to be at odds with it actually happening.</description>

      <title>Going Atomic: Why?</title>

      <description>This is the first in a series of technical posts by me about the internals of Selenium WebDriver. If you&amp;#8217;re not interested in technical nitty-gritty, then feel free to step away now.
Still here? Excellent.
Let&amp;#8217;s take a step back to just before the Selenium and WebDriver projects merged. There were, very obviously, two separate codebases. Looking closer and with a slightly different perspective, there were more than this. We used the test suites for webdriver to define the behaviour for multiple, largely independent, driver codebases.</description>
