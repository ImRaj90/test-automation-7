      <title>Fall Selenium Conf, Save the Date &amp; Call for Speakers!</title>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re excited to announce that we&amp;#8217;ve finally determined where and when Selenium Conf will be happening this Fall.
Our initial goal was to bring the event to a new country, but for a number of reasons that proved more challenging than we&amp;#8217;d hoped. But in 2012 we had the 2nd annual Selenium Conf in London, and we&amp;#8217;re pleased to be bringing it back there this year!
The conference will be held at The Mermaid in downtown London on November 14-16:</description>

      <description>It makes me enormously happy and proud to announce that the Selenium Conference 2014 will be held in Bangalore on the 4-6 September. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to seeing you there!
One of the plans we&amp;#8217;ve had from the very beginning for SeConf was that it was going to be a conference for the community of people who make Selenium such a fun project to work on. One way to do this was to host the conference where the largest groups of people using Selenium are found.</description>

      <description>This is a guest post by Marcus Merrell, one of the organizers of the 2013 Selenium Conference. 
Selenium/Webdriver has kept my family fed since 2007. Since I&amp;#8217;ve never committed a line of code to this magical project, I thought the least I could do was spend a few hours helping put SeConf 2013 together. When they asked for a volunteer to put the speaker program together, I was thrilled to step forward!</description>

      <description>In this series of blog posts we&amp;#8217;ve introduced one of the keynotes and talked about some of the great presentations you&amp;#8217;ll see at Selenium Conf &amp;#8217;12, but so far we&amp;#8217;ve missed the most important aspect of the entire event: you.
For me, one of the highlights of any conference is the chance to meet other members of the community, make new friends and talk about all things interesting (and perhaps even tangentially related to the conference!</description>

      <description>I may be biased, but I think Selenium Conf &amp;#8217;12 is going to be great. There are talks aimed at every level of Selenium user. We&amp;#8217;ve gotexperience reports, so you can learn from the trials and tribulations of others. There are talks about using Selenium in unusual ways, such as performance testing, orautomated security testing, so you can see new ideas and approaches.
There are technical talks, such as the one Jim Evans is giving on lessons learned from developing the IE driver, so you can learn a little bit more about how Selenium works and Luke Daley&amp;#8217;s talk about Geb is bound to be fun.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m really pleased to announce that Liz Keogh, who is a core member of the Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) community and is one of the stalwarts of the London Agile community, as well as a haiku poet, is going to be one of our keynotes!</description>

      <description>Good news, everybody! Selenium Conf &amp;#8217;12 is getting closer! We recently selected the speakers for the conference, and it&amp;#8217;s going to be a great mix of talks, spanning the full range of subjects from the very practical to the deeply technical. I&amp;#8217;m promised that there will be robots.
Selenium Conf isn&amp;#8217;t just about the planned talks, it&amp;#8217;s also about the community. On the final day, there will be an unconference, so if there&amp;#8217;s something you feel passionately about and feel the world should know, now&amp;#8217;s your chance.</description>

      <description>The community around Selenium is the thing that really makes the Selenium project special. Last year, we held the first official Selenium Conference in San Francisco, and it was both great fun and a huge success. It is therefore with great pleasure that we are announcing Selenium Conf &amp;#8217;12! It&amp;#8217;ll be taking place in London from the 16th to the 18th April, and we&amp;#8217;re really looking forward to seeing you all there!</description>

In order to figure out the rest of the details, we&amp;#8217;re looking for feedback from the Selenium user community. Please take a moment to fill out the following survey.</description>

      <description>The Selenium project does not have an &amp;#8216;official&amp;#8217; presence here at Agile as it is seen as a &amp;#8216;test after&amp;#8217; tool rather than &amp;#8216;test first&amp;#8217; &amp;#8212; even though it provides the magic of the &amp;#8216;test first&amp;#8217; frameworks&amp;#8230; But there is a small, unofficial contingent of recognizable faces around that can help people out and some sessions on it.
