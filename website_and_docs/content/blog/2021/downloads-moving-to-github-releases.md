  We are moving all Selenium binaries from Google Storage to GitHub releases.

Thanks to Google, [Google Storage](https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)
has been the central place where we have been able to upload all binaries created during each 
Selenium release, and the place where the Selenium community can download them. Most of the time, 
Selenium users need to go to the [downloads](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) page to find 
and get the correct link for the latest release, a process that sometimes takes longer than 
desired.

At the Selenium project, we have decided to upload all binaries to the corresponding release
in [GitHub](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/releases) in order to simplify the process
of finding the right binary for each release. When we complete the upload of all binaries, we 
will phase out the current Google Storage. 

We expect to complete this in the next couple of weeks and then announce the date where the 
binaries won't be available in Google Storage anymore.

If you are a watcher of the Selenium [repo](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium), please note
that there will be some noise in your inboxes. We need to create releases for old tags in order
to upload the binaries to the release (as is the way GitHub releases work).

If you have any questions or comments, please reach out through any of all the available options 
shown at https://www.selenium.dev/support/.

Stay tuned for updates by following [SeleniumHQ](https://twitter.com/seleniumhq)! 

Happy testing!
