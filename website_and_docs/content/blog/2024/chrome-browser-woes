#Two Chrome browser woes that might affect you

# Search engine selections creen

Starting with version 127 of Chrome, the browser [now asks which search engine you would like to use](https://www.google.com/chrome/choicescreen/), which is great for normal users.

But for automation, it does so every single time.

To bypass this, use the argument below when specifying the browser options.

```
--disable-search-engine-choice-screen
```

# Chrome wastes over 60MB of you bandwidth downloading language plugins

Every time you launch Chrome, [it will query and download several .crx files](https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/u78vd0/chrome_has_constantly_been_downloading_something/).

These files can even be left over on your disk's download folder if you create and close drivers faster than these can be processed.

To disable this feature, use the browser option below.

```
--disable-features=OptimizationGuideModelDownloading,OptimizationHintsFetching,OptimizationTargetPrediction,OptimizationHints
```
