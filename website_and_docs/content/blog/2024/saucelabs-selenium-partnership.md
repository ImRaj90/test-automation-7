It has been a great year for the Selenium community as it continues to grow. The popularity of Selenium’s Python Bindings is evident from the discussions at the Selenium Conference and on LinkedIn, while the Java bindings have impressively surpassed 100 million downloads...

This project, having reached 20 years old this year, would not be possible without the amazing contributions from our volunteer contributors and the Open Source Program Offices of companies like Sauce Labs that allow us to work on this project as part of our day jobs.

**About Sauce Labs**
Sauce Labs is a leader in continuous quality. Our Platform for Test helps organizations transform software testing from a chore to a competitive advantage. With decades of expertise and deep roots in the Selenium and Appium open source communities, high performing software teams use our platform to execute any testing workload across thousands of different devices, browsers, and operating systems—anywhere, any time, and at any scale.

This dedicated support has allowed us to continue work on the client bindings, especially the work going into WebDriver BiDi, support our community, continuously improve our documentation, and maintain all the extra projects we oversee, ensuring Selenium can continue to thrive for the next 20 years.
We are also thrilled to highlight the collaborative efforts between the Sauce Labs team, the Google Chrome team, Microsoft, Apple, BrowserStack, and the Firefox team, who have come together to build Selenium WebDriver BiDi, the next generation of Selenium. This collaborative spirit embodies our dedication to enhancing the testing experience for the Selenium user community.
With this in mind, the Selenium Project now shows our appreciation to Sauce Labs for their years of continued support by creating a new sponsorship tier called the Development Partner.

We are deeply indebted to Sauce Labs for all their support and are proud to recognize them as our first official Development Partner. This work has allowed us to continue progress on the client bindings, especially the work going into WebDriver BiDi, support our community, continuously improve our documentation, and maintain all the extra projects we oversee, so Selenium can continue to be around for the next 20 years!
