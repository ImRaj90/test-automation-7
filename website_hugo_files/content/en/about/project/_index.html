<p class="lead mt-2">
  The Selenium Project is formed by a community of users and Open Source contributors who develop, use and promote the different 
  Selenium projects (IDE, Grid, WebDriver) and other related activities, with the end goal of benefiting the community as a whole.
</p>

<p class="lead mt-2">
  The Selenium Project wants as much as possible to operate using procedures that are fair, open, inviting, and ultimately good 
  for the community. We want to make sure that no matter who you are, you have the opportunity to contribute to Selenium.
