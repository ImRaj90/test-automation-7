<p class="lead mt-2">
  The Selenium Project wants as much as possible to operate using procedures that are fair, open, inviting, and ultimately 
  good for the community. For that reason, we find it valuable to codify some of the ways that the Project goes about its 
  day-to-day business. We want to make sure that no matter who you are, you have the opportunity to contribute to Selenium. 
  We want to make sure that no corporation can exert undue influence on the community or hold the Project hostage. And 
  likewise, we want to make sure that corporations which benefit from Selenium are also incentivized to give back. This 
  document describes how various types of contributors work within the Selenium project.
