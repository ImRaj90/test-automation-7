  Selenium is certainly a team effort! There are several ways you can help out, whether you’re a 
  programmer, designer, QA engineer, writer, project manager, or just willing to help. If you’re 
  interested in helping, the best way to connect with us is at the Selenium Developers Group. 
  We’ll work with you to get you set up to contribute.

        We get a lot of questions and we have a great community to help answer them. 
        If you could register and log into the 
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-users">user group</a>
        to answer a question or two, that would be great! There are often some very 
        basic questions that are easy to answer.

      <p>
        For the most part, our documentation is held in source control for the main website. 
        The main documentation is in plain text so use your favorite editor offline to edit 
        the pages. The source for this main site is here and if you are familiar with Git you 
        should be able to bring it down to your local system for offline editing.

        If you find an error in our documentation, either a “typo” or inaccurate information. Please let us know. You can submit these in our bug tracker.

      <p>
        We have a lot of out-of-date information that needs to be tidied up on the 
        site! Help by writing documentation, producing helpful diagrams, re-skinning 
        the website, or organizing content.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can get started on working with the website by following the instructions on 
        our <a href="https://selenium.dev/documentation/en/contributing/">contributing</a> section.

    <div class="w-lg-75">
      <p>If you run into a problem with Selenium, feel free to file a bug report about it on our
        <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues">Bug Tracker</a>. Similarly, if 
        you have an idea for a feature you’d like to see in a future version, report that as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we would love help going through the bug reports and adding comments (which 
        automatically get sent to the reporter) for cases where advice is all that is needed.

        Although these templates help the clear structuring of an issue, please keep in mind 
        that bugs have to be reproducible and feature / change requests have to be understandable!
